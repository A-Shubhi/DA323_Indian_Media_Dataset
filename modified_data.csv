While our president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti has completed 10 months in this illegal detention, leaders from other parties like Ali Mohammad Sagar also continue to be under arrest. Even those released from jails have been put in detention in their homes. This is undemocratic, illegal and unethical,” Bukhari, Mehbooba’s adviser, told The Indian Express. Faesal and two PDP leaders—Peer Mansoor and Sartaj Madni—were released from detention on June 3. However, according to official sources, Faesal has been placed under house arrest alongside almost a dozen other political leaders. While a majority of the political leadership of Jammu and Kashmir has been released since January—they were among several political leaders who were detained in the aftermath of the August 5 scrapping of J&amp;K’s special status—there is a growing clamour for the release of the others, including PDP chief Mufti, senior National Conference leader Ali Mohammad Sagar, senior PDP leader Naeem Akhtar and NC’s North Kashmir MP Akbar Lone’s son Hilal Lone. All of them are being held under the Public Safety Act (PSA). Former CM and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah, who was released from detention under PSA in March, has repeatedly called for release of all political leaders. He recently tweeted: “Disappointed that @MehboobaMufti, Sagar Sb &amp; Hilal Lone continue to be detained. It’s high time they are set free as well. Not to mention the many others under informal ‘house arrest’ for the last 10 months. It’s time the rule of law is applied to all equally &amp; these leaders are allowed to leave their homes without their ‘guards’ locking them inside without cause, justification or any detention order.” Peoples Conference (PC) has also called for the immediate release of all political prisoners both within and outside J&amp;K. Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, senior NC leader Abdul Rahim Rather, NC spokesperson Aga Syed Ruhullah and NC leaders Irfan Shah, Shafi Uri and Nasir Sogami, and PDP youth president Waheed-ur-Rehman Para are among those under house arrest since they were released from SKICC or Srinagar’s MLA Hostel. Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Javed, who runs the former CM’s Twitter account, tweeted: “.barring a few, most political leaders cutting across party lines continue being under house arrest. Their unlawful detention is an aberration of the law.” She added that the “ad hoc releases of detainees defies common sense”.

In first remarks after the marathon meeting Saturday between Indian and Chinese army commanders at the Chushul-Moldo border point, the Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said it “took place in a cordial and positive atmosphere”. Read| India-China to resolve border tensions as per bilateral agreements: MEA on LAC standoff The statement underlined the “agreement between the leaders” of the two countries — announced after the informal summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan and Mahabalipuram — that “peace and tranquility in the India-China border regions is essential for the overall development of bilateral relations”. “Both sides also noted that this year marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and agreed that an early resolution would contribute to the further development of the relationship,” the MEA said. Sources said the discussions between the two sides was “frank”, and that South Block had got a sense of Beijing’s “sensitivities” following the talks Saturday and a videoconference of diplomats Friday. “This will be a long haul and small steps need to be taken to resolve the situation,” sources said, indicating that talks will continue at the Brigadier-level and the field level regularly and at the level of Joint Secretaries. Also Read | Line of Actual Control: Where it is located, and where India and China differ At the meeting Saturday, where the team leaders were Lt General Harinder Singh, XIV Corps Commander, and Major General Liu Lin, Commander of South Xinjiang Military District, the Indian side conveyed to the Chinese its central point about restoration of status quo ante in certain areas of eastern Ladakh along the LAC. An official said this was done by sharing comprehensive details of Chinese deployments as of April – and to which locations India wants the Chinese to go back - before the current round of tensions began. The Indian delegation also gave details of patrolling limits in various areas, followed hitherto but now being denied by the Chinese, and sought their restoration. Editorial | Undoing the damage A key issue in these talks was about the Pangong Tso area, where the Chinese have moved westward by 8 km, pitching tents and deploying soldiers according to their “perception” of the LAC. Besides altering the status quo, this has also meant that Indian patrols can no longer go up to the LAC, as marked in Army maps. The Indian side, sources said, raised the issue of the high number of Chinese troops and the aggression shown. While there was acknowledgement that aggressive behaviour must be dialled down, sources said the Indian side conveyed that patrolling must not be stopped. The Chinese side said they will look into it, but they also pointed to the building of Indian infrastructure. The Chinese build-up in the Galwan region is also at the heart of the standoff. Chinese commanders and officials have insisted that there is ""nothing unusual” about the deployment on their side of the LAC. This refusal to acknowledge the problem is being seen as a sign of their “intransigence” in the Galwan area, sources said. Explained | India-China stand-off: What we know about the unfolding situation in Ladakh The build-up in the Galwan area is worrying because it threatens the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road and access to forward posts near the Karakoram Pass. The Saturday talks lasted more than six hours. “Essentially, the conversation was more than three hours, since constant translation takes time,” sources said. The positive takeaway, sources said, is that the two sides agreed to keep talking — possibly at working levels — to address each other’s concerns. After the meeting, the Army briefed the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of External Affairs and the Prime Minister’s Office. Meanwhile, preparing for the eventuality of a stalemate, the Army has started making plans for extended deployment in the high-altitude terrain. After the delayed initial response due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Army moved a large number of troops and heavy military equipment into the area, mirroring the Chinese deployment. The challenge with these plans for extended deployment is to prepare for habitat and logistics for soldiers and equipment during the harsh Ladakh winter. This will stretch the Army’s resources in a tough economic environment – Army Chief General M M Naravane had told a seminar last month that the government had already asked the Army for a 20 per cent budget cut – at a time when the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan has become highly active and militancy too is rearing its head again in Kashmir. A related challenge for the Army, an official said, is to ensure that the PLA provides no more surprises at other places on the LAC. These fears stem from the recent incidents in areas such as Galwan, Hot Spring and Naku La where the two sides had agreed on the LAC. It would mean committing a substantial number of troops and equipment to operational roles. Meanwhile, China’s Global Times, a tabloid which often echoes the views of the ruling Communist Party of China, reported “large scale manoeuvre” by the PLA in which thousands of paratroopers and armoured vehicles can be deployed in “just a few hours”. “The mobilization operation came at a time when China and India face a new wave of tensions due to high altitude border issues, as reports say both sides have reinforced their border defences,” its report stated.",long,5857,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/04/sukhbir-singh-badal.jpg,"Justice Ranjit moves Supreme Court, notices issued to Sukhbir, Majithia","injustice Ranjit moves Supreme Court, notices issued to Sukhbir, Majithia","In first remarks after the marathon meeting Saturday between Indian and Chinese army commanders at the Chushul-Moldo border point, the Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said it “took place in a cordial and positive atmosphere”.

A May 22 communication from the Ministry of Home Affairs to Chairman, Railway Board, seeking 11 trains to transport 11,815 labourers from Jharkhand to work for the BRO in Ladakh and other areas, set off a series of communication between the state government and BRO. The state had received many complaints from labourers who were recently airlifted from Ladakh about not just delayed payments, but also lower wages than what was specified in the scheduled rate chart of BRO, and withholding of bank ATM cards by contractors. Read| COVID-19 notwithstanding, Border Roads Organisation works on throwing passes open before schedule In letters exchanged with BRO, the Jharkhand government raised serious concerns on the “plight” and “exploitation” of labourers from the state. In fact, Chief Minister Soren had earlier said it would be in the interest of labourers to take the government’s consent for work outside so that it could protect their rights. BRO’s commitment to directly recruit assumes significances a small percentage of worker salaries was actually taken by “mates”, who are themselves labourers, but coordinate with small groups of labourers, on behalf of the BRO. In letters to the Jharkhand government, BRO said “mates” are coordinators and ensure better command and control. Comparing “mates” with contractors in this case will “not be appropriate”, it said. Read| CM Hemant Soren: Those going to work in other states should seek Jharkhand nod When contacted, Jharkhand Chief Secretary Sukhdev Singh told The Indian Express, “Initially, there was a contractual system with no link between the BRO and the labourers. Now, an agreement has been reached that they will be recruited directly.” Based on the Hardness Index of the area of work and the skill of the labourers, the payments will range from Rs 15,900-29,000 for Ladakh with effect from June 10. It will be a marked increase from what labourers received earlier through “mates”. The Indian Express spoke to labourers, recruited through ‘mates’, and recently airlifted from Ladakh. * Pansal Marandi of Dumka, currently in transit, said his salary is Rs 10,000 per month. “’Mate’ has my ATM and he will give me money once I am back in Jharkhand. I came to know from other sources that my actual salary is Rs 16,000, but I don’t get that amount.” * Raj Kishore Marandi of Dumka said his salary for the last five months was pending. “The mate had kept the ATM with himself and says he will pay the money in sometime. I don’t know how much I get in my account,” he said. * Sanatan Besra of Jamtara said he receive Rs 9,000 per month: “I was paid around Rs 50,000 after I returned. But the ATM remains with the ‘Mate’. He kept a portion with himself and gave me the remaining amount in cash.” *Soilen Soreng of West Singhbhum area said he has not been paid for the last eight months. “I used to get Rs 10,000 per month which the “mate” told me will be given after some time. He has my ATM.” In a letter to the BRO, Principal Secretary Labour Rajeev Arun Ekka said the organisation’s claim that it directly engaged with workers “surprised him”. “They (labourers) have returned home with bitter memories and experiences. Government of Jharkhand is deeply concerned at the plight of these labourers…It is also surprising that these workers were not receiving appropriate payments through bank accounts and cheques as per wages fixed in the scheduled rate chart of BRO,” Ekka wrote. In the letter, he said that there is no provision of “mates” in the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act. “And this is in gross violation of the Act. This also opens the door of exploitation of poor tribal workers in the hands of middlemen and touts,” Ekka wrote. He asked for BRO’s registration in Jharkhand and an MoU for the recruitment of labourers. Through the letters, the state government demanded that an agreement be signed by the the BRO with the state. Brigadier Nitin K Sharma, DDG (TP) for Director General, Border Roads, explained in the letter: “BRO is committed to safeguard the interest of the labourers who are backbone. It has been the constant endeavour of BRO to ensure that the aspirations of its labourers are met and their legitimate wages are paid in time.” The labourers would also be eligible for host of other benefits like medical facilities, injury benefits, rations, clothing, accommodation, free conveyance, and fixing of wages via Boards constituted at different projects for this purpose, he said in the letter. “BRO will undertake recruitment of labour directly without involvement of any contractor or Mate,” Sharma said in the letter. Seeking a one-time waiver from registration in the “interest of work and national security implications”, the BRO said it would apply for registration with the states as an establishment employing migrant labour for year 2021-22 and that it will sign an MoU with Jharkhand once it is approved by the Defence Ministry. Accepting the request for a one-time waiver, Chief Minister Soren said: “National Security is our priority and at the same time we have prioritised that honour, dignity and rights of our workers are guaranteed while serving the nation.” When contacted, BRO’s public relation officer Lt Col DA Johnson said, he was not aware of the development. “I cannot comment as I have no information.”",mid,5638,POSITIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/modi-trump1.jpg,"Six sets of dates, February to September, on table for Trump’s visit to India","Six sets of dates, February to September, on table against Trump’s visit to India","A May 22 communication from the Ministry of Home Affairs to Chairman, Railway Board, seeking 11 trains to transport 11,815 labourers from Jharkhand to work for the BRO in Ladakh and other areas, set off a series of communication between the state government and BRO.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/as-bro-seeks-workers-for-ladakh-jharkhand-asks-for-a-better-deal-for-them-6447878/

However, as per credible sources, the killed terrorists belonged to proscribed HM terrorist outfit and one among the killed terrorists is believed to be a top commander. In case any family claims the killed terrorists to be their kith or kin, (they) can come forward for the identification,” police said in a statement. Police officers said that based on an input about the presence of militants in the area, a cordon-and-search operation was launched in Reban area of Shopian. While a search was on, militants opened fire at the security forces, triggering a gunbattle around 8.30 am. In the meantime, clashes broke out in the area after local residents tried to head to the encounter site, and youth hurled stones at the security personnel. Authorities snapped mobile Internet in Shopian and Kulgam districts. Three militants were killed by afternoon. In the evening, IGP Vijay Kumar said the number of militants killed in the operation totalled five. Srinagar-based Defence spokesperson Colonel Rajesh Kalia said: “Joint operation launched in early hours today on JK Police input. Cordon laid &amp; contact established. Firefight ensued. Five terrorists eliminated. Good drills ensured no collateral damage. Operation in progress.” An officer said security forces have recovered three AK-47s and two pistols – an indication that two of the militants likely joined the group recently.",long,2160,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/khattar-1.jpg,All MLAs will get chance to speak before budget presentation: Manohar Lal Khattar,All MLAs will get chance to speak beagainste budget presentation: Manohar Lal Khattar,The identities of the militants have not yet been disclosed but police said they probably belonged to the Hizbul Mujahideen and one of them was likely a top commander.,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/five-militants-killed-in-shopian-gunbattle-likely-a-hizbul-group-6447786/

Addressing a virtual press conference, Singh said that Scindia was like his son. He said, “When he (Scindia) was with the Congress, he had a say in appointing district presidents from Morena to Mandsaur. No other leader got the same respect in the Congress as you did. It won’t happen now because the RSS calls the shots in the BJP and you have criticised it in the past.” “Maybe you were in a hurry to get into Narendra Modi’s ministry,” Singh said, adding that the voters will “teach a lesson” to those who brought down the Kamal Nath-led Congress government a lesson in the ensuing by-elections to 24 seats. When asked whether the Congress would shift its MLAs in the state to resorts ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections, Singh said, “Those who could be bought over have already gone,” referring to the party’s leaders and legislators, led by Scindia, who switched over to the BJP, bringing down the Nath government in March. “There are many legislators for whom even Rs 1 crore means a lot, but they did not succumb even when offered huge sums,” he said, taking a dig at the MLAs who defected to BJP, allegedly after being offered sums in excess of Rs 30 crore. Singh also claimed he had conveyed to Scindia that while both he and Nath are in their 70s and would soon fade away, the former Guna MP had two-three decades of active politics before him. Recalling that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had brought the anti-defection law, Singh said the law should now be amended again to ban people’s representatives who change parties from contesting for six years.

On May 5, at 1.30 am she developed labour pain. “The civil hospital here has been converted into a Covid-19 facility. Private nursing homes nearby were also shut,” her husband Chandrakant Birade said. With nowhere to go, they woke up an elderly woman in the neighbourhood around 4 am to deliver the baby. A month since Ronak’s birth, no immunisation shot has been administered to the child against infections like hepatitis, measles, and polio. From institutional deliveries to ante-natal care, immunisation to Anganwadi schemes, the Covid-19 pandemic has hit all crucial healthcare services. The effects have rippled in tribal stretches as well. Forty km from Jalgaon, Asrabari village near Satpura range has not been visited by any Anganwadi workers or Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) since March. The village, housing Tadvis and Pawaras tribes, has not reported any Covid-19 case but the lockdown has hit services for pregnant women. Aged 17, Sangeeta Ramsar is six-month pregnant with her first child. “I have not gone to a primary health centre, and no one came here to check me,” she said. She has to walk 7 km to reach the nearest village where public transport was available until March. Since the lockdown, even that transport is lost. Her neighbour Reshma Bodya delivered her fifth son a fortnight ago in a hut. “Yahan koi gadi nahi hai. Shehar band pada hai virus ke karan. Hospital kaise jaye (There is no vehicle here. The city is shut due to coronavirus. How do we go to hospital),” said Khedya Patil, a tribal woman. District health officer Dr DS Potode said since Asrabari is a tribal area, the institutional delivery rate is already low there. “In nearby villages, we have a facility for delivery at the primary health centre,” he said. According to MLA Girish Mahajan, Jalgaon civil hospital was performing 1,000 childbirths in a month. “Since it became a Covid-19 facility, there have been zero deliveries there. Another private hospital, Godavari, has been converted into a civil hospital, but it has performed only 200 deliveries. Every other health service has been affected since the civil hospital has been converted,” Mahajan said. In Parola taluka, Mangrul primary health centre has 148 pregnant women registered since March after lockdown, of them 37 are first-time pregnancies, all eligible for Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), a scheme under which Rs 5,000 is given to a woman for her first delivery. Nurse Ankita Aadhav said since the pandemic began, data entry procedures have come to a standstill. “We have not been able to link bank accounts and Aadhaar. None of these women has received the first installment of Rs 2,000,” she said. As per government norms, immunisation activity, ante-natal check-ups are prohibited in containment and buffer zones where Covid-19 positive cases are diagnosed to prevent the risk of transmission. “We have allowed these health services outside containment zones. So, services may be slightly affected in containment areas,” said Dr Archana Patil, additional director in Directorate of Health Services. “But we are managing to meet targets for immunisation and deliveries,” she added. Anup Kumar Yadav, director of National Health Mission, admitted the health services were hit in March and April as resources were diverted to address the Covid-19 pandemic. “The state government kept rural hospitals, primary health centres and sub-centres free from Covid-19 activities to focus on other services to solve these issues,” he said. But in several districts ASHAs have been engaged in Covid-19 survey of migrants, affecting mother and child care services. “Our focus is to find migrants, who travelled from outside, and quarantine them. After that if there is time, I focus on immunisation and ante-natal care,” said ASHA worker Swati Patil in Mangrul village. Maharashtra performs 80,000-90,000 deliveries in government sector per month. State officials said corporations like Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Jalgaon, and Malegaon that have been hit by Covid-19 are facing problems with routine health services. Pregnant and lactating women are also not able to avail Bharat Ratna APJ Abdul Kalam Amrut Yojna in parts of state. In Akkalkuan, Dhadgaon, and Toranmal areas of Nandurbar, Anganwadis are shut and pregnant women are getting no ration, a review meeting held in the first week of June found. Food for children aged up to six years has also been affected. In May, Nandurbar district data found that 15,402 children were screened at Akkalkuan, known for a high malnourishment rate, and 2.3 per cent were found severely underweight and 12.6 per cent moderately underweight. In Jalgaon, no such screening of children for malnourishment has been carried out for the last three months, when such an exercise must be undertaken at least once a month. Anganwadi worker Seema Patil said, “We can’t do house-to-house visits to weigh children, as there is Covid-19 scare. There is also a problem of ration. We had asked for ration for 65 children, for nine children no ration came.” Health secretary, Dr Pradeep Vyas, admitted that the pandemic had hit other services. “We are working on normalising routine services,” he said.

The blue sheets have replaced pieces of the metal blown away by squally winds brought by Cyclone Nisarga that on June 3 made landfall near the sleepy town known for its pristine beaches. “We could hear the winds – whoosh, whoosh – long before the cyclone came. The rooftops, the windows started rattling. I was so scared by that deafening sound that I could not dare to open my eyes,” says the fisherwoman in a magenta nine-yard sari. The Chunekars’ residence offers an unobstructed view of the Arabian Sea and the coast of Shrivardhan. On June 3, however, from their house with the enviable view, the Chunekars were among the few who saw the severe cyclonic storm Nisarga, which had been forming over the Arabian Sea for 124 hours, arrive in all its fury. “It was dark and smoky all day. The winds were blowing at speeds like never before. It lasted about an hour to an hour-and-a-half. Then we saw it over the sea. It looked like a large spinning top,” says Malati’s husband Kashinath Chunekar. The fishing jetty is devoid of both people and boats that were pulled ashore after the cyclone warning was issued. Right outside the Maharashtra Maritime Board office, however, one lies crushed under a banyan tree, next to a coconut tree that is bent like it was being folded in half. Janardan Waghe and his eight-year-old son Bhavik are by themselves at the jetty trying to catch small fish for lunch. Bhavik waits with the empty woven bag he had brought to collect the catch, as his father throws his fishing net in the water for the third time in vain. “What we saw was beyond our imagination. The winds just blew away the rooftops of our homes. Splintered roofs hovered in the wind like butterflies,” says Janardan. In the municipal school near the jetty, around 300 people who were evacuated ahead of the cyclone continue to stay put in addition to those who had to move there after their homes were wrecked. The classrooms are now filled with LGP cylinders, utensils, beddings and cries of babies. “Everything was scattered by the winds. We just picked up whatever utensils we could gather. We don’t even know if they are ours or someone else’s,” says Govind Kalekar, who has moved into the school with his family. Even as road connectivity to the main highways in Raigad was restored a day after Nisarga struck, roads in the interiors, connecting one village to another, were still being rid of displaced trees, branches and scree. On the Bagmandla road that leads to four villages, debris was being removed by the State Disaster Rescue Force (SDRF) men in orange, who had been sawing heavy tree branches to clear the roads all day. S M Kedar, the Talathi of Maral-Bagmandla, said that the men had been sawing fallen barks and branches since sunrise and nobody was keeping a count of how many were removed. With power sub-stations and electricity polls destroyed, several parts of Raigad have been relegated to the dark. In Shrivardhan, telecommunication has been hamstrung with some cellular services available intermittently. Shrivardhan Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) Amit Shetye says, “Our priority is to clear all the roads first. The connectivity to the main highway was restored the very next day, however, some internal roads had to be cleared, which is being done continuously.” While inverters and generators have been used to light up some places like government offices, power lines in Shrivardhan should be resurrected in a fortnight, said officials. An official of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) sat atop a tiled roof detangling and snapping electric cables from a pole that had descended on it. Ninad Kawle, assistant engineer with the MSEB, says they have been through at least 250 such poles in Shrivardhan since June 3. The cables, he adds, were being preserved for when the poles are re-erected. Electricity poles avulsed from the ground and trees wedged into roofs are a common sight across Raigad. On state highways, in neighbouring talukas of Mangaon and Mhasla, too, Nisarga left the same trail of destruction. Beyond the Bagmandla road lay the downhill villages of Karivne and Bauddhawadi, which after nearly four days of being incommunicado, were reaching out to people outside. Mayur Pawar, a resident of Virar who was back in his village after the lockdown, drove in his four-wheeler to make an SOS call on behalf of his village. “We have not been able to reach anyone in the last four days. No government official was able to visit us because the roads were blocked. There is a lot of damage to our village,” he says. Abhijeet Mane, the gram sevak of the village, had arrived in Karivne on Saturday on his two-wheeler. “There are 126 homes in this village. I have drawn up a list of relatives of all the families who stay in Mumbai, which I will take back to the tehsildar office. We will inform their relatives that they are all right,” he says. Perhaps the starkest testimony to the wrath of Nisarga stands in Shrivardhan’s Vetalwadi. The formidable Banyan tree that even the elders had grown up watching, is left bearing its roots, split down the middle, resembling the mangled carcass of an animal devoured by a mightier beast. Had it survived another day, it would have been worshipped by married women on Vat Purnima, the full moon day on which Maharashtrian Hindu women pray for their husbands’ long life by tying a tread around the tree’s bark. Shrivardhan is now a swarm of perhaps lakhs of fallen trees, some heaving with fruit – mangoes, coconuts, bananas, jackfruits – but rubbing their face in the soil, some uprooted, others hunched. Mushtaq Satvilkar owned mango and coconut orchards behind his house on which an electricity pole had fallen. “For the first time, I may have to go to the market to buy a coconut. Shrivardhan was famous for its trees, its greenery and its beaches. This is what attracted tourists. Tourism was hit by the lockdown and now the greenery is gone too,” he says. As an immediate relief measure, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced a Rs 100-crore relief package for Raigad. Raigad MP Sunil Tatkare said that the Centre’s help may also be sought. On Sunday, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal announced that the government will provide free kerosene to families living without electricity. Meanwhile, the district administration, the NDRF, the SDRF, the municipal council and the people are doing their part to help Shrivardhan dust itself up, albeit slowly, without electricity and Internet. The relief measures may take their time but the people cannot. As much as they hope for swift government intervention, they say, the monsoon is fast approaching and they have a town to rebuild.",long,6841,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/anilviz.jpg,"Amid reports that CID may be moved out of Home, Anil Vij questions ‘intention’","Amid reports that CID may be moved out of Home, Anil Vij questions ‘intention’","“We could hear the winds – whoosh, whoosh – long before the cyclone came.

Thousands of farmers in Kerala have either abandoned cultivation or have stopped nursing their farm lands, especially those close to forest patches, due to the frequent raids by wild elephants, wild boars and of late, monkeys. The state economic review 2019 has stated that “despite the proactive measures of the (forest) department in mitigating the problems of human-animal conflicts, it continues unresolved. extreme damages are caused by wild elephants and wild boars. Various measures that were adopted include digging elephant-proof trenches, creating elephant-proof walls, constructing solar-powered electric fences. In spite of these preventive measures, it is alarming to note that the number of incidents of human-animal conflict is increasing year by year. In 2018-19, as many as 7,890 incidents were reported, whereas it was 7,229 in 2017-18.’’ A senior forest department officer said, “Many plantations near forests have become land of fodder for wild elephants. New-generation farmers do not stay in estates or farm lands in remote villages and areas adjacent to forests. Loss-making estates and farm lands are unattended. The absence of regular human presence has made such lands a perfect haven for elephants. There would be enough fodder and items such as jackfruits in such lands. In the past, farmers used to take up the job of wildlife protection by preventing the entry of animals into farms. Now, that job has come to forest officials only.” Read | Death of an elephant Forest department data shows that between 2015 and 2020, 416 wild elephants died in Kerala, with 24 deaths attributed to “unnatural causes” — hunting, electrocution, being hit by vehicles and by explosives. During the same period, 514 people were killed in attacks by wild animals, including elephants. In 2019 alone, 15 people were killed in elephant attacks. There have been 246 cases related to wildlife crime in Kerala in 2019. Two weeks back, the state-run Aralam Farming Corporation in Kannur district was forced to close down 600 acres of an estate block due to elephant menace. As many as 21 wild elephants trooped into the estate from a nearby wildlife sanctuary, stayed in the human habitat for several days, and killed a tribal worker and damaged vast tracts of vegetation. Over the past one year, the estate, which is spread over 4,000 acres, had suffered a loss of Rs 4 crore due to elephant raids, according to official sources. The forest department official said the fragmentation of forests in the state has also led to elephants straying into farmlands. “Due to mining and other human interventions, elephant habitats have been disturbed. We have to ensure fodder in forests. Also, elephant corridors have to be protected. Eco-tourism projects have ended up as waste-generating ventures in forests,” he said. However, while the threat of elephants is mainly felt in areas close to forest regions, the presence of wild boars has emerged as a threat to food security in villages and semi-urban areas. In many places, farmers are struggling to protect tubular crops and other food products, forcing them to trap the animals, scare them away using crackers, poison them or even gunning them down. The forest department official said, “The population of wild boars has increased manifold even in non-forest areas. Jackals used to be the predator of wild boar cubs. Now, the jackal population has gone down. The use of pesticides, mainly in paddy fields and banana plantations, has turned fatal for jackals, which perished in large numbers after consuming crabs which died of exposure to lethal pesticides in such farms. Farmers have to be blamed for creating such a situation.” The previous Congress government in the state, bowing to pressure from farmers, passed an order that stated that wild boars — barring feeding and pregnant ones — which stray into farms could be culled by forest officials in the presence of local vigilante committees. However, this order could not be implemented due to its complexities, including the issue of identifying pregnant wild boars. Also, only uniformed persons were allowed to gun down the animal. Last month, the current CPI(M)-led government modified the order to the effect that any person with a licenced gun could shoot down wild boar which posed a threat to cultivation. With this move, any person with a licensed gun — but without no criminal background — can kill wild boar. However, there are very few licensed guns in Kerala. Kerala Farmers Federation general secretary Joshy Joseph said, “Farmers do not go to forest to provoke the animals. Wild boars have to be controlled for the survival of farmers. The raid of elephants shows that the animals do not have fodder and water in their habitat. The government has to take steps to ensure availability of fodder for elephants in forests. No farmer can suffer the loss of crops at the time of harvest, especially after having nursed them for years. Many people who blame farmers over the man-animal conflict do not know the pain of cultivation.”",mid,5343,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/stalin.jpg,DMK: Skipped anti-CAA meet over Tamil Nadu Congress chief’s remarks,DMK: Skipped anti-CAA meet over Tamil Nadu Congress chief’s remarks,"Thousands of farmers in Kerala have either abandoned cultivation or have stopped nursing their farm lands, especially those close to forest patches, due to the frequent raids by wild elephants, wild boars and of late, monkeys.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/elephant-death-brings-to-fore-man-animal-conflict-in-kerala-6447800/

He joined the Shiv Sena, created a social media platform in Marathi, developed a mobile phone application, assisted investigating agencies, appeared on several news channels and wrote two books. On Saturday, Vaze, police constables Rajendra Tiwari and Sunil Desai resumed duty in the local arms unit, while constable Rajaram Nikam was reinstated in the motor vehicle department. Despite repeated attempts, Vaze did not respond to calls. Sources said that over the last few years when Vaze saw his mentors, senior policemen (retired) Pradeep Sharma and Daya Nayak, being inducted back into the police force after facing a slew of allegations and enquiries, he too was hopeful despite the ongoing Khwaja Yunus case. Vaze was alleged to have disposed Yunus’ body after the purported custodial killing. A senior officer said that Vaze had started out in Thane, where he along with other officers played a role in keeping the Suresh Manchekar gang, active in the area, under control. When an IPS officer from Thane moved to Mumbai, he got Vaze along with him. Here, he was posted with the crime branch CIU where he got in touch with “encounter specialist” Pradeep Sharma. “Vaze has been close to Sharma right through his career. Working with the team, he too started being called an 'encounter specialist', although primarily he was in Sharma's shadow,” an officer said. “He (Vaze) was media savvy and had his name and photos appear in newspapers and TV channels. In 2004, however, due to his alleged role in the Khwaja Yunus case, he was suspended and later submitted his resignation in 2007. However, the resignation had not been accepted and hence he could be reinstated,” an officer said. After tendering his resignation, Vaze had joined the Shiv Sena in 2008. His lawyer said he was in the Sena for some time. Known to be good with technology, in 2010 he also started a social networking site called 'Lai Bhari'. Vaze had also reportedly developed a software. He also wrote two books, one on the Sheena Bora murder case and the other on David Headley, the LeT operative involved in the 26/11 terror attack, who later turned an approver. “Away from the force, his services were also used by some investigative agencies as well. He also appeared on several news channels as an ‘expert’,” an officer said. On December 25, 2002, Yunus along with three others was arrested by the Mumbai police under Prevention of Terrorism Activities Act for their alleged role in a bomb blast at Ghatkopar on December 2. Subsequently, the POTA court had acquitted all the men arrested with Yunus. On January 6, the last day Yunus was seen alive, his then co-accused had allegedly seen him being stripped and severely assaulted. Later, the police had claimed that Vaze and three others were taking Yunus to Aurangabad to follow a lead and that the vehicle they were traveling in met with an accident and Yunus had escaped. Based on an inquiry ordered by the POTA court, the CID booked Vaze and the three constables on charges of murder. Yunus' family also approached various courts seeking to make other policemen accused in the case, who eyewitnesses had said, to have seen assault him. The state government did not sanction for them to be made accused and pleas regarding adding them to stand trial remain pending before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the trial before the Sessions Court went on in a staggered manner with the first witness deposing on January 17, 2018. The witness named four other policemen who he had seen Yunus being assaulted. Based on this testimony, the then special public prosecutor moved a plea in court to add the four policemen as accused. Within two months, the prosecutor, Dhiraj Mirajkar was removed by the state government. Yunus’ mother, Asiya Begum, has approached the High Court challenging the removal. The state government informed the HC that since the petition is pending, it will not appoint another prosecutor to conduct the trial. Since 2018, the trial, therefore, has remained stalled. The petition in HC is yet to be decided upon. The accused policemen, including Vaze, have also contested the murder charge against them stating that based on the chargesheet filed by the CID, there is no evidence to show that they had been involved in assault or murder of Yunus. His mother Asiya Begum, based in Parbhani, said that she was apprehensive that the reinstatement of Vaze could adversely affect the case which has already been prolonged for so many years.",long,4785,POSITIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/satpal-satti.jpg,JNU is a muftkhoron ka adda… its name should be changed: Satpal Singh Satti,JNU is a muftkhoron ka adda… its name should be changed: Satpal Singh Satti,"On Saturday, Vaze along with police constables Rajendra Tiwari and Sunil Desai resumed duty in the local arms unit, while constable Rajaram Nikam was reinstated in the motor vehicle department.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sena-member-author-app-designer-the-many-hats-donned-by-cop-sachin-vaze-reinstated-after-16-yrs-6447783/

The senior BJP leader said the virtual rally was a “way to connect with party workers up to the booth level and the people of Bihar”. Asserting that it is not an election rally, he slammed Opposition parties for calling it so. The Bihar Assembly elections are due in October-November. “This rally is aimed at connecting people with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign. The BJP will have 75 such meetings,” Shah said in his address. He said the Centre helped more than 1.25 crore migrants return to their home states during the Covid-19 pandemic. He added that migrants from Bihar had to be “respected as they had contributing to building other states with their blood and sweat”. He said, “It did hurt to see people start walking for their homes, but we immediately arranged buses and later ran Shramik special trains. Indian Railways bore 85 per cent of the cost of fares and we could help about 1.25 crore migrants reach their homes.” Shah congratulated the combined leadership of CM Nitish Kumar and his Deputy Sushil Kumar Modi for dealing with Covid-related and migrants’ issues. “The Bihar government alone spent Rs 8,538 crore for relief of its people and migrants who returned to the state,” he said. The home minister said the Bihar government had taken GDP growth of 3.9 per cent in RJD-Congress rule to 11.3 per cent under Nitish-led NDA government. ""The state budget size has gone up from Rs 23,800 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 2,11,761 crore in 2020-21. Electricity supply is available to 100 per cent households now as against 22 per cent availability in RJD rule,” said Shah, challenging the RJD to offer any other comparative data. Naming Nitish thrice in his speech, Shah said: “Though this is not an election rally, Nitish Kumar-led NDA will return to power with two-thirds majority. Bihar is a journey from lantern to LED.” Shah, however, did not mention LJP, another NDA partner. Speaking about the Centre's contribution to Bihar, Shah said Rs 354.5 crore had been transferred to Jan Dhan accounts of 2.38 crore people, LPG cylinders worth Rs 630 crore had been given to 84.4 lakh beneficiaries. ""Now with 'one nation, one ration' scheme, people will get their share of subsidised grains wherever they are in the country.” Shah added that a contentious issue like Ayodhya was resolved because the central government made a strong case for Ram’s birthplace in the court. He also said that no one would have thought that special status for J&amp;K could be abrogated. The Bihar BJP claimed that seven party workers watched the virtual rally at each of the 72,000 polling booths, besides thousands from the electorate in Bihar on YouTube, Facebook Live and NaMo app. RJD Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who got his party workers to beat plates outside their homes before Shah's virtual rally, said: ""The NDA government does not bother about the poor whose plates are empty. We are opposing the BJP’s virtual rally as it is insensitive to think of elections when Covid cases are surging in Bihar.” Deputy CM Sushil Modi said: ""It is Laluwad versus Vikaswad in Bihar.

While issuing set of guidelines to reopen restaurants, shopping malls and religious places/places of worship, chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh said that all the guests from non high-load Covid-19 cities will have to stay for a minimum of seven days and will not be allowed to visit public places and tourism spots. When asked why were customers required to stay for the given minimum period, officials said that if a person is carrying some infection, there are chances of manifestation within seven days. If people keep coming and going, it will become difficult to track the cases, they added. “Initially when we are starting, we want to be cautious. Those who are coming, surveillance of their health status will be done,” Singh said.

While our president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti has completed 10 months in this illegal detention, leaders from other parties like Ali Mohammad Sagar also continue to be under arrest. Even those released from jails have been put in detention in their homes. This is undemocratic, illegal and unethical,” Bukhari, Mehbooba’s adviser, told The Indian Express. Faesal and two PDP leaders—Peer Mansoor and Sartaj Madni—were released from detention on June 3. However, according to official sources, Faesal has been placed under house arrest alongside almost a dozen other political leaders. While a majority of the political leadership of Jammu and Kashmir has been released since January—they were among several political leaders who were detained in the aftermath of the August 5 scrapping of J&amp;K’s special status—there is a growing clamour for the release of the others, including PDP chief Mufti, senior National Conference leader Ali Mohammad Sagar, senior PDP leader Naeem Akhtar and NC’s North Kashmir MP Akbar Lone’s son Hilal Lone. All of them are being held under the Public Safety Act (PSA). Former CM and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah, who was released from detention under PSA in March, has repeatedly called for release of all political leaders. He recently tweeted: “Disappointed that @MehboobaMufti, Sagar Sb &amp; Hilal Lone continue to be detained. It’s high time they are set free as well. Not to mention the many others under informal ‘house arrest’ for the last 10 months. It’s time the rule of law is applied to all equally &amp; these leaders are allowed to leave their homes without their ‘guards’ locking them inside without cause, justification or any detention order.” Peoples Conference (PC) has also called for the immediate release of all political prisoners both within and outside J&amp;K. Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, senior NC leader Abdul Rahim Rather, NC spokesperson Aga Syed Ruhullah and NC leaders Irfan Shah, Shafi Uri and Nasir Sogami, and PDP youth president Waheed-ur-Rehman Para are among those under house arrest since they were released from SKICC or Srinagar’s MLA Hostel. Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Javed, who runs the former CM’s Twitter account, tweeted: “.barring a few, most political leaders cutting across party lines continue being under house arrest. Their unlawful detention is an aberration of the law.” She added that the “ad hoc releases of detainees defies common sense”.

In first remarks after the marathon meeting Saturday between Indian and Chinese army commanders at the Chushul-Moldo border point, the Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said it “took place in a cordial and positive atmosphere”. Read| India-China to resolve border tensions as per bilateral agreements: MEA on LAC standoff The statement underlined the “agreement between the leaders” of the two countries — announced after the informal summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan and Mahabalipuram — that “peace and tranquility in the India-China border regions is essential for the overall development of bilateral relations”. “Both sides also noted that this year marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and agreed that an early resolution would contribute to the further development of the relationship,” the MEA said. Sources said the discussions between the two sides was “frank”, and that South Block had got a sense of Beijing’s “sensitivities” following the talks Saturday and a videoconference of diplomats Friday. “This will be a long haul and small steps need to be taken to resolve the situation,” sources said, indicating that talks will continue at the Brigadier-level and the field level regularly and at the level of Joint Secretaries. Also Read | Line of Actual Control: Where it is located, and where India and China differ At the meeting Saturday, where the team leaders were Lt General Harinder Singh, XIV Corps Commander, and Major General Liu Lin, Commander of South Xinjiang Military District, the Indian side conveyed to the Chinese its central point about restoration of status quo ante in certain areas of eastern Ladakh along the LAC. An official said this was done by sharing comprehensive details of Chinese deployments as of April – and to which locations India wants the Chinese to go back - before the current round of tensions began. The Indian delegation also gave details of patrolling limits in various areas, followed hitherto but now being denied by the Chinese, and sought their restoration. Editorial | Undoing the damage A key issue in these talks was about the Pangong Tso area, where the Chinese have moved westward by 8 km, pitching tents and deploying soldiers according to their “perception” of the LAC. Besides altering the status quo, this has also meant that Indian patrols can no longer go up to the LAC, as marked in Army maps. The Indian side, sources said, raised the issue of the high number of Chinese troops and the aggression shown. While there was acknowledgement that aggressive behaviour must be dialled down, sources said the Indian side conveyed that patrolling must not be stopped. The Chinese side said they will look into it, but they also pointed to the building of Indian infrastructure. The Chinese build-up in the Galwan region is also at the heart of the standoff. Chinese commanders and officials have insisted that there is ""nothing unusual” about the deployment on their side of the LAC. This refusal to acknowledge the problem is being seen as a sign of their “intransigence” in the Galwan area, sources said. Explained | India-China stand-off: What we know about the unfolding situation in Ladakh The build-up in the Galwan area is worrying because it threatens the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road and access to forward posts near the Karakoram Pass. The Saturday talks lasted more than six hours. “Essentially, the conversation was more than three hours, since constant translation takes time,” sources said. The positive takeaway, sources said, is that the two sides agreed to keep talking — possibly at working levels — to address each other’s concerns. After the meeting, the Army briefed the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of External Affairs and the Prime Minister’s Office. Meanwhile, preparing for the eventuality of a stalemate, the Army has started making plans for extended deployment in the high-altitude terrain. After the delayed initial response due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Army moved a large number of troops and heavy military equipment into the area, mirroring the Chinese deployment. The challenge with these plans for extended deployment is to prepare for habitat and logistics for soldiers and equipment during the harsh Ladakh winter. This will stretch the Army’s resources in a tough economic environment – Army Chief General M M Naravane had told a seminar last month that the government had already asked the Army for a 20 per cent budget cut – at a time when the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan has become highly active and militancy too is rearing its head again in Kashmir. A related challenge for the Army, an official said, is to ensure that the PLA provides no more surprises at other places on the LAC. These fears stem from the recent incidents in areas such as Galwan, Hot Spring and Naku La where the two sides had agreed on the LAC. It would mean committing a substantial number of troops and equipment to operational roles. Meanwhile, China’s Global Times, a tabloid which often echoes the views of the ruling Communist Party of China, reported “large scale manoeuvre” by the PLA in which thousands of paratroopers and armoured vehicles can be deployed in “just a few hours”. “The mobilization operation came at a time when China and India face a new wave of tensions due to high altitude border issues, as reports say both sides have reinforced their border defences,” its report stated.",mid,5857,POSITIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/10/akhilesh.jpg,"‘Get out, You could be from BJP, RSS’: Akhilesh to doctor while meeting patients in Kannauj","‘Get out, You could be from BJP, RSS’: Akhilesh to doctor while meeting patients in Kannauj","In first remarks after the marathon meeting Saturday between Indian and Chinese army commanders at the Chushul-Moldo border point, the Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said it “took place in a cordial and positive atmosphere”.

A May 22 communication from the Ministry of Home Affairs to Chairman, Railway Board, seeking 11 trains to transport 11,815 labourers from Jharkhand to work for the BRO in Ladakh and other areas, set off a series of communication between the state government and BRO. The state had received many complaints from labourers who were recently airlifted from Ladakh about not just delayed payments, but also lower wages than what was specified in the scheduled rate chart of BRO, and withholding of bank ATM cards by contractors. Read| COVID-19 notwithstanding, Border Roads Organisation works on throwing passes open before schedule In letters exchanged with BRO, the Jharkhand government raised serious concerns on the “plight” and “exploitation” of labourers from the state. In fact, Chief Minister Soren had earlier said it would be in the interest of labourers to take the government’s consent for work outside so that it could protect their rights. BRO’s commitment to directly recruit assumes significances a small percentage of worker salaries was actually taken by “mates”, who are themselves labourers, but coordinate with small groups of labourers, on behalf of the BRO. In letters to the Jharkhand government, BRO said “mates” are coordinators and ensure better command and control. Comparing “mates” with contractors in this case will “not be appropriate”, it said. Read| CM Hemant Soren: Those going to work in other states should seek Jharkhand nod When contacted, Jharkhand Chief Secretary Sukhdev Singh told The Indian Express, “Initially, there was a contractual system with no link between the BRO and the labourers. Now, an agreement has been reached that they will be recruited directly.” Based on the Hardness Index of the area of work and the skill of the labourers, the payments will range from Rs 15,900-29,000 for Ladakh with effect from June 10. It will be a marked increase from what labourers received earlier through “mates”. The Indian Express spoke to labourers, recruited through ‘mates’, and recently airlifted from Ladakh. * Pansal Marandi of Dumka, currently in transit, said his salary is Rs 10,000 per month. “’Mate’ has my ATM and he will give me money once I am back in Jharkhand. I came to know from other sources that my actual salary is Rs 16,000, but I don’t get that amount.” * Raj Kishore Marandi of Dumka said his salary for the last five months was pending. “The mate had kept the ATM with himself and says he will pay the money in sometime. I don’t know how much I get in my account,” he said. * Sanatan Besra of Jamtara said he receive Rs 9,000 per month: “I was paid around Rs 50,000 after I returned. But the ATM remains with the ‘Mate’. He kept a portion with himself and gave me the remaining amount in cash.” *Soilen Soreng of West Singhbhum area said he has not been paid for the last eight months. “I used to get Rs 10,000 per month which the “mate” told me will be given after some time. He has my ATM.” In a letter to the BRO, Principal Secretary Labour Rajeev Arun Ekka said the organisation’s claim that it directly engaged with workers “surprised him”. “They (labourers) have returned home with bitter memories and experiences. Government of Jharkhand is deeply concerned at the plight of these labourers…It is also surprising that these workers were not receiving appropriate payments through bank accounts and cheques as per wages fixed in the scheduled rate chart of BRO,” Ekka wrote. In the letter, he said that there is no provision of “mates” in the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act. “And this is in gross violation of the Act. This also opens the door of exploitation of poor tribal workers in the hands of middlemen and touts,” Ekka wrote. He asked for BRO’s registration in Jharkhand and an MoU for the recruitment of labourers. Through the letters, the state government demanded that an agreement be signed by the the BRO with the state. Brigadier Nitin K Sharma, DDG (TP) for Director General, Border Roads, explained in the letter: “BRO is committed to safeguard the interest of the labourers who are backbone. It has been the constant endeavour of BRO to ensure that the aspirations of its labourers are met and their legitimate wages are paid in time.” The labourers would also be eligible for host of other benefits like medical facilities, injury benefits, rations, clothing, accommodation, free conveyance, and fixing of wages via Boards constituted at different projects for this purpose, he said in the letter. “BRO will undertake recruitment of labour directly without involvement of any contractor or Mate,” Sharma said in the letter. Seeking a one-time waiver from registration in the “interest of work and national security implications”, the BRO said it would apply for registration with the states as an establishment employing migrant labour for year 2021-22 and that it will sign an MoU with Jharkhand once it is approved by the Defence Ministry. Accepting the request for a one-time waiver, Chief Minister Soren said: “National Security is our priority and at the same time we have prioritised that honour, dignity and rights of our workers are guaranteed while serving the nation.” When contacted, BRO’s public relation officer Lt Col DA Johnson said, he was not aware of the development. “I cannot comment as I have no information.”",short,5638,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/12/mamta-759.jpg,"UP BJP MLA: Mamata Banerjee is like a demon, has no values of a woman","UP BJP MLA: Mamata Banerjee is like a demon, has no values of a woman","A May 22 communication from the Ministry of Home Affairs to Chairman, Railway Board, seeking 11 trains to transport 11,815 labourers from Jharkhand to work for the BRO in Ladakh and other areas, set off a series of communication between the state government and BRO.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/as-bro-seeks-workers-for-ladakh-jharkhand-asks-for-a-better-deal-for-them-6447878/

He said, “When he (Scindia) was with the Congress, he had a say in appointing district presidents from Morena to Mandsaur. No other leader got the same respect in the Congress as you did. It won’t happen now because the RSS calls the shots in the BJP and you have criticised it in the past.” “Maybe you were in a hurry to get into Narendra Modi’s ministry,” Singh said, adding that the voters will “teach a lesson” to those who brought down the Kamal Nath-led Congress government a lesson in the ensuing by-elections to 24 seats. When asked whether the Congress would shift its MLAs in the state to resorts ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections, Singh said, “Those who could be bought over have already gone,” referring to the party’s leaders and legislators, led by Scindia, who switched over to the BJP, bringing down the Nath government in March. “There are many legislators for whom even Rs 1 crore means a lot, but they did not succumb even when offered huge sums,” he said, taking a dig at the MLAs who defected to BJP, allegedly after being offered sums in excess of Rs 30 crore. Singh also claimed he had conveyed to Scindia that while both he and Nath are in their 70s and would soon fade away, the former Guna MP had two-three decades of active politics before him. Recalling that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had brought the anti-defection law, Singh said the law should now be amended again to ban people’s representatives who change parties from contesting for six years.

On May 5, at 1.30 am she developed labour pain. “The civil hospital here has been converted into a Covid-19 facility. Private nursing homes nearby were also shut,” her husband Chandrakant Birade said. With nowhere to go, they woke up an elderly woman in the neighbourhood around 4 am to deliver the baby. A month since Ronak’s birth, no immunisation shot has been administered to the child against infections like hepatitis, measles, and polio. From institutional deliveries to ante-natal care, immunisation to Anganwadi schemes, the Covid-19 pandemic has hit all crucial healthcare services. The effects have rippled in tribal stretches as well. Forty km from Jalgaon, Asrabari village near Satpura range has not been visited by any Anganwadi workers or Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) since March. The village, housing Tadvis and Pawaras tribes, has not reported any Covid-19 case but the lockdown has hit services for pregnant women. Aged 17, Sangeeta Ramsar is six-month pregnant with her first child. “I have not gone to a primary health centre, and no one came here to check me,” she said. She has to walk 7 km to reach the nearest village where public transport was available until March. Since the lockdown, even that transport is lost. Her neighbour Reshma Bodya delivered her fifth son a fortnight ago in a hut. “Yahan koi gadi nahi hai. Shehar band pada hai virus ke karan. Hospital kaise jaye (There is no vehicle here. The city is shut due to coronavirus. How do we go to hospital),” said Khedya Patil, a tribal woman. District health officer Dr DS Potode said since Asrabari is a tribal area, the institutional delivery rate is already low there. “In nearby villages, we have a facility for delivery at the primary health centre,” he said. According to MLA Girish Mahajan, Jalgaon civil hospital was performing 1,000 childbirths in a month. “Since it became a Covid-19 facility, there have been zero deliveries there. Another private hospital, Godavari, has been converted into a civil hospital, but it has performed only 200 deliveries. Every other health service has been affected since the civil hospital has been converted,” Mahajan said. In Parola taluka, Mangrul primary health centre has 148 pregnant women registered since March after lockdown, of them 37 are first-time pregnancies, all eligible for Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), a scheme under which Rs 5,000 is given to a woman for her first delivery. Nurse Ankita Aadhav said since the pandemic began, data entry procedures have come to a standstill. “We have not been able to link bank accounts and Aadhaar. None of these women has received the first installment of Rs 2,000,” she said. As per government norms, immunisation activity, ante-natal check-ups are prohibited in containment and buffer zones where Covid-19 positive cases are diagnosed to prevent the risk of transmission. “We have allowed these health services outside containment zones. So, services may be slightly affected in containment areas,” said Dr Archana Patil, additional director in Directorate of Health Services. “But we are managing to meet targets for immunisation and deliveries,” she added. Anup Kumar Yadav, director of National Health Mission, admitted the health services were hit in March and April as resources were diverted to address the Covid-19 pandemic. “The state government kept rural hospitals, primary health centres and sub-centres free from Covid-19 activities to focus on other services to solve these issues,” he said. But in several districts ASHAs have been engaged in Covid-19 survey of migrants, affecting mother and child care services. “Our focus is to find migrants, who travelled from outside, and quarantine them. After that if there is time, I focus on immunisation and ante-natal care,” said ASHA worker Swati Patil in Mangrul village. Maharashtra performs 80,000-90,000 deliveries in government sector per month. State officials said corporations like Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Jalgaon, and Malegaon that have been hit by Covid-19 are facing problems with routine health services. Pregnant and lactating women are also not able to avail Bharat Ratna APJ Abdul Kalam Amrut Yojna in parts of state. In Akkalkuan, Dhadgaon, and Toranmal areas of Nandurbar, Anganwadis are shut and pregnant women are getting no ration, a review meeting held in the first week of June found. Food for children aged up to six years has also been affected. In May, Nandurbar district data found that 15,402 children were screened at Akkalkuan, known for a high malnourishment rate, and 2.3 per cent were found severely underweight and 12.6 per cent moderately underweight. In Jalgaon, no such screening of children for malnourishment has been carried out for the last three months, when such an exercise must be undertaken at least once a month. Anganwadi worker Seema Patil said, “We can’t do house-to-house visits to weigh children, as there is Covid-19 scare. There is also a problem of ration. We had asked for ration for 65 children, for nine children no ration came.” Health secretary, Dr Pradeep Vyas, admitted that the pandemic had hit other services. “We are working on normalising routine services,” he said.

The blue sheets have replaced pieces of the metal blown away by squally winds brought by Cyclone Nisarga that on June 3 made landfall near the sleepy town known for its pristine beaches. “We could hear the winds – whoosh, whoosh – long before the cyclone came. The rooftops, the windows started rattling. I was so scared by that deafening sound that I could not dare to open my eyes,” says the fisherwoman in a magenta nine-yard sari. The Chunekars’ residence offers an unobstructed view of the Arabian Sea and the coast of Shrivardhan. On June 3, however, from their house with the enviable view, the Chunekars were among the few who saw the severe cyclonic storm Nisarga, which had been forming over the Arabian Sea for 124 hours, arrive in all its fury. “It was dark and smoky all day. The winds were blowing at speeds like never before. It lasted about an hour to an hour-and-a-half. Then we saw it over the sea. It looked like a large spinning top,” says Malati’s husband Kashinath Chunekar. The fishing jetty is devoid of both people and boats that were pulled ashore after the cyclone warning was issued. Right outside the Maharashtra Maritime Board office, however, one lies crushed under a banyan tree, next to a coconut tree that is bent like it was being folded in half. Janardan Waghe and his eight-year-old son Bhavik are by themselves at the jetty trying to catch small fish for lunch. Bhavik waits with the empty woven bag he had brought to collect the catch, as his father throws his fishing net in the water for the third time in vain. “What we saw was beyond our imagination. The winds just blew away the rooftops of our homes. Splintered roofs hovered in the wind like butterflies,” says Janardan. In the municipal school near the jetty, around 300 people who were evacuated ahead of the cyclone continue to stay put in addition to those who had to move there after their homes were wrecked. The classrooms are now filled with LGP cylinders, utensils, beddings and cries of babies. “Everything was scattered by the winds. We just picked up whatever utensils we could gather. We don’t even know if they are ours or someone else’s,” says Govind Kalekar, who has moved into the school with his family. Even as road connectivity to the main highways in Raigad was restored a day after Nisarga struck, roads in the interiors, connecting one village to another, were still being rid of displaced trees, branches and scree. On the Bagmandla road that leads to four villages, debris was being removed by the State Disaster Rescue Force (SDRF) men in orange, who had been sawing heavy tree branches to clear the roads all day. S M Kedar, the Talathi of Maral-Bagmandla, said that the men had been sawing fallen barks and branches since sunrise and nobody was keeping a count of how many were removed. With power sub-stations and electricity polls destroyed, several parts of Raigad have been relegated to the dark. In Shrivardhan, telecommunication has been hamstrung with some cellular services available intermittently. Shrivardhan Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) Amit Shetye says, “Our priority is to clear all the roads first. The connectivity to the main highway was restored the very next day, however, some internal roads had to be cleared, which is being done continuously.” While inverters and generators have been used to light up some places like government offices, power lines in Shrivardhan should be resurrected in a fortnight, said officials. An official of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) sat atop a tiled roof detangling and snapping electric cables from a pole that had descended on it. Ninad Kawle, assistant engineer with the MSEB, says they have been through at least 250 such poles in Shrivardhan since June 3. The cables, he adds, were being preserved for when the poles are re-erected. Electricity poles avulsed from the ground and trees wedged into roofs are a common sight across Raigad. On state highways, in neighbouring talukas of Mangaon and Mhasla, too, Nisarga left the same trail of destruction. Beyond the Bagmandla road lay the downhill villages of Karivne and Bauddhawadi, which after nearly four days of being incommunicado, were reaching out to people outside. Mayur Pawar, a resident of Virar who was back in his village after the lockdown, drove in his four-wheeler to make an SOS call on behalf of his village. “We have not been able to reach anyone in the last four days. No government official was able to visit us because the roads were blocked. There is a lot of damage to our village,” he says. Abhijeet Mane, the gram sevak of the village, had arrived in Karivne on Saturday on his two-wheeler. “There are 126 homes in this village. I have drawn up a list of relatives of all the families who stay in Mumbai, which I will take back to the tehsildar office. We will inform their relatives that they are all right,” he says. Perhaps the starkest testimony to the wrath of Nisarga stands in Shrivardhan’s Vetalwadi. The formidable Banyan tree that even the elders had grown up watching, is left bearing its roots, split down the middle, resembling the mangled carcass of an animal devoured by a mightier beast. Had it survived another day, it would have been worshipped by married women on Vat Purnima, the full moon day on which Maharashtrian Hindu women pray for their husbands’ long life by tying a tread around the tree’s bark. Shrivardhan is now a swarm of perhaps lakhs of fallen trees, some heaving with fruit – mangoes, coconuts, bananas, jackfruits – but rubbing their face in the soil, some uprooted, others hunched. Mushtaq Satvilkar owned mango and coconut orchards behind his house on which an electricity pole had fallen. “For the first time, I may have to go to the market to buy a coconut. Shrivardhan was famous for its trees, its greenery and its beaches. This is what attracted tourists. Tourism was hit by the lockdown and now the greenery is gone too,” he says. As an immediate relief measure, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced a Rs 100-crore relief package for Raigad. Raigad MP Sunil Tatkare said that the Centre’s help may also be sought. On Sunday, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal announced that the government will provide free kerosene to families living without electricity. Meanwhile, the district administration, the NDRF, the SDRF, the municipal council and the people are doing their part to help Shrivardhan dust itself up, albeit slowly, without electricity and Internet. The relief measures may take their time but the people cannot. As much as they hope for swift government intervention, they say, the monsoon is fast approaching and they have a town to rebuild.",mid,6841,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/delhi-gangrape-convicts.jpg,Delhi gangrape convict Mukesh files mercy plea after SC junks curative petitions,Delhi gangrape convict Mukesh files mercy plea after SC junks curative petitions,"“We could hear the winds – whoosh, whoosh – long before the cyclone came.

Thousands of farmers in Kerala have either abandoned cultivation or have stopped nursing their farm lands, especially those close to forest patches, due to the frequent raids by wild elephants, wild boars and of late, monkeys. The state economic review 2019 has stated that “despite the proactive measures of the (forest) department in mitigating the problems of human-animal conflicts, it continues unresolved. extreme damages are caused by wild elephants and wild boars. Various measures that were adopted include digging elephant-proof trenches, creating elephant-proof walls, constructing solar-powered electric fences. In spite of these preventive measures, it is alarming to note that the number of incidents of human-animal conflict is increasing year by year. In 2018-19, as many as 7,890 incidents were reported, whereas it was 7,229 in 2017-18.’’ A senior forest department officer said, “Many plantations near forests have become land of fodder for wild elephants. New-generation farmers do not stay in estates or farm lands in remote villages and areas adjacent to forests. Loss-making estates and farm lands are unattended. The absence of regular human presence has made such lands a perfect haven for elephants. There would be enough fodder and items such as jackfruits in such lands. In the past, farmers used to take up the job of wildlife protection by preventing the entry of animals into farms. Now, that job has come to forest officials only.” Read | Death of an elephant Forest department data shows that between 2015 and 2020, 416 wild elephants died in Kerala, with 24 deaths attributed to “unnatural causes” — hunting, electrocution, being hit by vehicles and by explosives. During the same period, 514 people were killed in attacks by wild animals, including elephants. In 2019 alone, 15 people were killed in elephant attacks. There have been 246 cases related to wildlife crime in Kerala in 2019. Two weeks back, the state-run Aralam Farming Corporation in Kannur district was forced to close down 600 acres of an estate block due to elephant menace. As many as 21 wild elephants trooped into the estate from a nearby wildlife sanctuary, stayed in the human habitat for several days, and killed a tribal worker and damaged vast tracts of vegetation. Over the past one year, the estate, which is spread over 4,000 acres, had suffered a loss of Rs 4 crore due to elephant raids, according to official sources. The forest department official said the fragmentation of forests in the state has also led to elephants straying into farmlands. “Due to mining and other human interventions, elephant habitats have been disturbed. We have to ensure fodder in forests. Also, elephant corridors have to be protected. Eco-tourism projects have ended up as waste-generating ventures in forests,” he said. However, while the threat of elephants is mainly felt in areas close to forest regions, the presence of wild boars has emerged as a threat to food security in villages and semi-urban areas. In many places, farmers are struggling to protect tubular crops and other food products, forcing them to trap the animals, scare them away using crackers, poison them or even gunning them down. The forest department official said, “The population of wild boars has increased manifold even in non-forest areas. Jackals used to be the predator of wild boar cubs. Now, the jackal population has gone down. The use of pesticides, mainly in paddy fields and banana plantations, has turned fatal for jackals, which perished in large numbers after consuming crabs which died of exposure to lethal pesticides in such farms. Farmers have to be blamed for creating such a situation.” The previous Congress government in the state, bowing to pressure from farmers, passed an order that stated that wild boars — barring feeding and pregnant ones — which stray into farms could be culled by forest officials in the presence of local vigilante committees. However, this order could not be implemented due to its complexities, including the issue of identifying pregnant wild boars. Also, only uniformed persons were allowed to gun down the animal. Last month, the current CPI(M)-led government modified the order to the effect that any person with a licenced gun could shoot down wild boar which posed a threat to cultivation. With this move, any person with a licensed gun — but without no criminal background — can kill wild boar. However, there are very few licensed guns in Kerala. Kerala Farmers Federation general secretary Joshy Joseph said, “Farmers do not go to forest to provoke the animals. Wild boars have to be controlled for the survival of farmers. The raid of elephants shows that the animals do not have fodder and water in their habitat. The government has to take steps to ensure availability of fodder for elephants in forests. No farmer can suffer the loss of crops at the time of harvest, especially after having nursed them for years. Many people who blame farmers over the man-animal conflict do not know the pain of cultivation.”",short,5343,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/06/nadella-759.jpg,Satya Nadella on CAA: Would love to see a Bangla immigrant create unicorn in India,Satya Nadella on CAA: Would love to see a Bangla immigrant create unicorn in India,"Thousands of farmers in Kerala have either abandoned cultivation or have stopped nursing their farm lands, especially those close to forest patches, due to the frequent raids by wild elephants, wild boars and of late, monkeys.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/elephant-death-brings-to-fore-man-animal-conflict-in-kerala-6447800/

The hospital denied the allegation, saying the patient was tied to the bed because he was having convulsions due to hypernatremia and would have hurt himself. Dr Varun Bajaj of the hospital said it was a common practice. He said when the hospital asked for the remaining Rs 11,000 from the daughter, she said she had no money. She had paid Rs 10,800. Dr Bajaj said the hospital called the police, but the daughter refused to pay, and that the hospital discharged the patient on the advice of police. He shared a letter written by the daughter denying the allegation that the hospital refused to let her go for non-payment of money. The letter said the hospital waived the remaining amount.

He joined the Shiv Sena, created a social media platform in Marathi, developed a mobile phone application, assisted investigating agencies, appeared on several news channels and wrote two books. On Saturday, Vaze, police constables Rajendra Tiwari and Sunil Desai resumed duty in the local arms unit, while constable Rajaram Nikam was reinstated in the motor vehicle department. Despite repeated attempts, Vaze did not respond to calls. Sources said that over the last few years when Vaze saw his mentors, senior policemen (retired) Pradeep Sharma and Daya Nayak, being inducted back into the police force after facing a slew of allegations and enquiries, he too was hopeful despite the ongoing Khwaja Yunus case. Vaze was alleged to have disposed Yunus’ body after the purported custodial killing. A senior officer said that Vaze had started out in Thane, where he along with other officers played a role in keeping the Suresh Manchekar gang, active in the area, under control. When an IPS officer from Thane moved to Mumbai, he got Vaze along with him. Here, he was posted with the crime branch CIU where he got in touch with “encounter specialist” Pradeep Sharma. “Vaze has been close to Sharma right through his career. Working with the team, he too started being called an 'encounter specialist', although primarily he was in Sharma's shadow,” an officer said. “He (Vaze) was media savvy and had his name and photos appear in newspapers and TV channels. In 2004, however, due to his alleged role in the Khwaja Yunus case, he was suspended and later submitted his resignation in 2007. However, the resignation had not been accepted and hence he could be reinstated,” an officer said. After tendering his resignation, Vaze had joined the Shiv Sena in 2008. His lawyer said he was in the Sena for some time. Known to be good with technology, in 2010 he also started a social networking site called 'Lai Bhari'. Vaze had also reportedly developed a software. He also wrote two books, one on the Sheena Bora murder case and the other on David Headley, the LeT operative involved in the 26/11 terror attack, who later turned an approver. “Away from the force, his services were also used by some investigative agencies as well. He also appeared on several news channels as an ‘expert’,” an officer said. On December 25, 2002, Yunus along with three others was arrested by the Mumbai police under Prevention of Terrorism Activities Act for their alleged role in a bomb blast at Ghatkopar on December 2. Subsequently, the POTA court had acquitted all the men arrested with Yunus. On January 6, the last day Yunus was seen alive, his then co-accused had allegedly seen him being stripped and severely assaulted. Later, the police had claimed that Vaze and three others were taking Yunus to Aurangabad to follow a lead and that the vehicle they were traveling in met with an accident and Yunus had escaped. Based on an inquiry ordered by the POTA court, the CID booked Vaze and the three constables on charges of murder. Yunus' family also approached various courts seeking to make other policemen accused in the case, who eyewitnesses had said, to have seen assault him. The state government did not sanction for them to be made accused and pleas regarding adding them to stand trial remain pending before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the trial before the Sessions Court went on in a staggered manner with the first witness deposing on January 17, 2018. The witness named four other policemen who he had seen Yunus being assaulted. Based on this testimony, the then special public prosecutor moved a plea in court to add the four policemen as accused. Within two months, the prosecutor, Dhiraj Mirajkar was removed by the state government. Yunus’ mother, Asiya Begum, has approached the High Court challenging the removal. The state government informed the HC that since the petition is pending, it will not appoint another prosecutor to conduct the trial. Since 2018, the trial, therefore, has remained stalled. The petition in HC is yet to be decided upon. The accused policemen, including Vaze, have also contested the murder charge against them stating that based on the chargesheet filed by the CID, there is no evidence to show that they had been involved in assault or murder of Yunus. His mother Asiya Begum, based in Parbhani, said that she was apprehensive that the reinstatement of Vaze could adversely affect the case which has already been prolonged for so many years.",mid,4785,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/Chidambaram.jpg,NPR a disguised bid to do Assam-like NRC: Chidambaram,NPR a guised bid to do Assam-like NRC: Chidambaram,"On Saturday, Vaze along with police constables Rajendra Tiwari and Sunil Desai resumed duty in the local arms unit, while constable Rajaram Nikam was reinstated in the motor vehicle department.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sena-member-author-app-designer-the-many-hats-donned-by-cop-sachin-vaze-reinstated-after-16-yrs-6447783/

The senior BJP leader said the virtual rally was a “way to connect with party workers up to the booth level and the people of Bihar”. Asserting that it is not an election rally, he slammed Opposition parties for calling it so. The Bihar Assembly elections are due in October-November. “This rally is aimed at connecting people with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign. The BJP will have 75 such meetings,” Shah said in his address. He said the Centre helped more than 1.25 crore migrants return to their home states during the Covid-19 pandemic. He added that migrants from Bihar had to be “respected as they had contributing to building other states with their blood and sweat”. He said, “It did hurt to see people start walking for their homes, but we immediately arranged buses and later ran Shramik special trains. Indian Railways bore 85 per cent of the cost of fares and we could help about 1.25 crore migrants reach their homes.” Shah congratulated the combined leadership of CM Nitish Kumar and his Deputy Sushil Kumar Modi for dealing with Covid-related and migrants’ issues. “The Bihar government alone spent Rs 8,538 crore for relief of its people and migrants who returned to the state,” he said. The home minister said the Bihar government had taken GDP growth of 3.9 per cent in RJD-Congress rule to 11.3 per cent under Nitish-led NDA government. ""The state budget size has gone up from Rs 23,800 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 2,11,761 crore in 2020-21. Electricity supply is available to 100 per cent households now as against 22 per cent availability in RJD rule,” said Shah, challenging the RJD to offer any other comparative data. Naming Nitish thrice in his speech, Shah said: “Though this is not an election rally, Nitish Kumar-led NDA will return to power with two-thirds majority. Bihar is a journey from lantern to LED.” Shah, however, did not mention LJP, another NDA partner. Speaking about the Centre's contribution to Bihar, Shah said Rs 354.5 crore had been transferred to Jan Dhan accounts of 2.38 crore people, LPG cylinders worth Rs 630 crore had been given to 84.4 lakh beneficiaries. ""Now with 'one nation, one ration' scheme, people will get their share of subsidised grains wherever they are in the country.” Shah added that a contentious issue like Ayodhya was resolved because the central government made a strong case for Ram’s birthplace in the court. He also said that no one would have thought that special status for J&amp;K could be abrogated. The Bihar BJP claimed that seven party workers watched the virtual rally at each of the 72,000 polling booths, besides thousands from the electorate in Bihar on YouTube, Facebook Live and NaMo app. RJD Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who got his party workers to beat plates outside their homes before Shah's virtual rally, said: ""The NDA government does not bother about the poor whose plates are empty. We are opposing the BJP’s virtual rally as it is insensitive to think of elections when Covid cases are surging in Bihar.” Deputy CM Sushil Modi said: ""It is Laluwad versus Vikaswad in Bihar.

A joint statement by the Indian Public Health Association (IPHA), Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM) and Indian Association of Epidemiologists (IAE) had last week accused the government of not having consulted “epidemiologists who had better grasp of disease transmission dynamics compared to modelers”. “These apprehensions and allegations are unfounded and baseless. The government is constantly in consultation with experts for technical and strategic inputs, scientific ideas and domain-specific guidance to address the Covid-19 pandemic. A National Task Force (NTF) for Covid-19 is constituted by Secretary DHR-cum-DG-ICMR with Member (Health) NITI Aayog as Chairperson and Secretary (DoHFW) and Secretary (DHR) as Co-Chairs. The NTF comprises 21 members, including technical/domain experts from the government and outside the government. Predominant expertise in the Task Force is from public health and/or epidemiology. Given the complexity and implications of the Covid-19 pandemic, the group has experts from medicine, virology, pharmacology and programme implementation domains, as well,” read a statement issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Task Force constituted four expert groups, the statement added, on Epidemiology and Surveillance (with 13 members) and on Operations Research (with 15 members) that almost entirely include public health and epidemiology experts from the government and non-government arena.

The joint statement also mentioned that it is unrealistic to expect that the pandemic can be eliminated at this stage given that community transmission is already well-established across large sections or sub-populations in the country. The government has consistently denied community transmission. The Health Ministry stated, “The Task Force has held over 20 meetings and has systematically contributed towards the scientific and technical response to the pandemic.” As is well known in public health, different stages of epidemic demand different response and a nuanced, step-wise response is known to be a positive characteristic of a resilient health system, the government said, adding that the people, the WHO and the global health community have appreciated India’s proactive and pre-emptive approach.",mid,2843,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/raveesh_kumar_7.jpg,"MEA summons Pak Charge d’affairs over killing of Sikh man, Nankana incident","MEA summons Pak Charge d’affairs over killing of Sikh man, Nankana incident","Among the signatories in the joint statement were Dr Shashi Kant, Professor and Head of the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, and Dr D C S Reddy, former Professor and Head of Community Medicine at BHU.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/claims-that-covid-strategy-excluded-experts-baseless-govt-6447736/

Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have four seats each to fill; Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan three seats each; and Jharkhand two. Elections will also be held for a seat each from Manipur and Meghalaya. Ahead of the vote, political activity has picked up pace in Gujarat, and three Congress MLAs have resigned in the past few days, adding to the desertions seen earlier in March. The Congress now has 65 MLAs in the 182-member House, 12 fewer than the 77 seats it won in the 2017 elections to the state Assembly. These 65 MLAs were on Saturday (June 6) packed off to three resorts in Ambaji, Rajkot, and Vadodara to secure them from BJP attempts at “poaching”. Here’s the big picture on what is happening, and why. The return of political activity in state Elections to four Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat were due on March 26. Due to retire on April 9 were Chunibhai Gohel who belongs to Junagadh district, Shambhuprasad Tundiya from Ahmedabad, and Lalsinh Vadodia from Anand district (all from the BJP), and the veteran Congressman and AICC general secretary Madhusudan Mistry. Ahead of the elections, five Congress MLAs resigned from the Assembly, and the Congress herded the remaining 68 to a resort, Hotel Shiv Vilas in Jaipur in Congress-ruled Rajasthan, to protect its votes. But then the coronavirus struck, the country went into a national lockdown on March 24, and all elections were postponed. After the Election Commission announced June 19 as the fresh date for the election, the Congress’s problem of desertions returned. Two MLAs - Akshay Patel from Karjan in Central Gujarat and Jitu Chaudhary from Kaprada in South Gujarat - resigned on June 3, reducing the party’s Assembly number to 66. More were rumoured to be quitting - and on June 5, a third MLA, Brijesh Merja, tendered his resignation to Speaker Rajendra Trivedi, and also gave up his primary membership of the Congress party. The resignations from the Assembly matter in the Rajya Sabha election because with the total number of MLAs coming down, the number of votes needed for a candidate to win also comes down, as per the formula. The votes both BJP and Congress want The Gujarat Assembly, whose strength is 182, is currently left with 172 MLAs (not counting the Speaker) - of which 103 are from the BJP, 65 Congress, 1 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), 1 Independent, and 2 Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP). Each candidate needs 35 votes to win. As of now, the Congress is four votes short of winning two seats, while the BJP needs two more votes to retain its three seats. There are four votes in the Assembly which both parties are eyeing to bridge the shortfall. Two of these are MLAs of the BTP, which was founded by MLA and tribal leader Chhotu Vasava and his son Mahesh following a split in the Janata Dal (United), which Chhotu earlier represented. Chhotu is believed to have helped veteran Congressman Ahmed Patel enter Rajya Sabha in 2017. However, the equations between the Vasavas and the Congress have changed since. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last year, the Congress tried to strike a deal with Chhotu by proposing that he contest on the hand symbol - but he did not agree. In the 2019 Rajya Sabha elections, in which External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar was a candidate, the father-son duo voted against the Congress, although they denied it in public. Two Congress MLAs, Alpesh Thakor and his associate Dhavalsinh Zala too, cross-voted - and later quit the party and joined the BJP. The third vote is that of Kandhal Jadeja, the NCP MLA from Kutiyana who has been voting for the BJP since 2017. In 2019, in spite of a whip issued by the NCP state president Shankersinh Vaghela to vote for the Congress, Jadeja, according to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, had voted for the BJP. The fourth vote up for grabs is that of Jignesh Mevani, the Independent legislator who is a fierce critic of the BJP, and very close to Congress’s Hardik Patel. Why the Rajya Sabha election is important Of the seven seats Gujarat has in Rajya Sabha currently, four are held by the BJP, and the rest by the Congress. The Rajya Sabha elections had been a tame affair until August 2017, when Ahmed Patel faced a fierce contest from a Congress turncoat, Balwantsinh Rajput, whom the BJP nominated as its third candidate for the three vacancies. The other two seats were won by then BJP national president Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani. Congress Leader of Opposition Shankersinh Vaghela led the rebellion by quitting weeks before polling day, and six MLAs followed him - leading to a close contest between Ahmed Patel and Rajput. Rajput challenged Patel’s election in the high court, and the case remains pending. However the Congress’s improved score in the Assembly elections in December that year when it won 77 seats, against the BJP’s 99, gave it a better chance in the next Rajya Sabha election in 2019, where Union Minister Jaishankar was contesting. At the time of this election, the Gujarat Assembly had 175 MLAs - 100 of the BJP, 71 Congress, 2, BTP, 1 NCP and 1 Independent. The equations have changed after some MLAs won Lok Sabha seats vacating their Assembly seats. However, the two Congress candidates, Gaurav Pandya and Chandrikaben Chudasama, got 70 votes each, against BJP candidates Jaishankar who got 104, and Jugal Thakor who got 105 votes. Mevani had voted for the Congress. “They are preparing for the upcoming local body polls which are due later this year. the BJP obviously aims to ensure that the Congress has as few seats as possible to even contest. So, with only one seat to fight for the Congress now, the BJP will also try to have as many MLAs within the Congress who are willing to vote against the party. It is about prestige and numbers,” a senior leader said. The BJP’s not-so-unknown closeness to the NCP, which has a small presence in the state but has a significant role when voting numbers matter, is also a factor. The party is looking at a stronger hold on Anand district, which has been a Congress bastion and home to Bharatsinh Solanki as well as GPCC president Amit Chavda, and feels the NCP’s support can help its cause, which could also be a reason why the NCP replaced Vaghela as its state unit president to appoint former MLA from this district Jayant Patel alias Boskey. The Congress has seen the district slowly slip away over the past three years. The BJP has also been wishing for complete control over Amul Dairy, which had been under Congress control for several years, until former Congress MLA from Thasra Ramsinh Parmar, the chairman of Amul, defected to the BJP ahead of the 2017 RS polls. The candidates The BJP has nominated well-known lawyer Abhay Bhardwaj from Rajkot, and former government officer Ramilaben Bara, a tribal from Sabarkantha, as its candidates, while the Congress candidates are national spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil and former Union minister Bharatsinh Solanki. However, the equations changed when the BJP announced a third candidate in Narhari Amin, a former Congress veteran and a Patidar, who joined the party in 2012. The Congress will have to fight not just the BJP but also the disenchantment of its ranks with its leaders. Dilip Bhatt, former district president of the Vadodara Congress, says that the party’s leaders are “extremely unhappy” with the GPCC, especially the leadership of its president Amit Chavda, who is “disconnected” from the grassroot workers, and who has been accused multiple times by different leaders of being inaccessible. “We have made it clear that we don’t see Bharatsinh Solanki as a leader (although he has been a GPCC president).

Prithvi Singh, 46, a resident of Sangrah in Sirmaur district who was working as a liasioning officer for a Punjab-based firm Bioaide, was arrested by the state anti-corruption and vigilance bureau on Saturday, an official said. Singh allegedly recorded a 43-second audio clip of his telephonic conversation with Dr AK Gupta, then DHS, in which the duo were purportedly heard discussing the handover of Rs 5 lakh. The clip went viral, leading to Gupta's arrest on May 20. According to the vigilance bureau, Gupta and Singh were discussing the exchange of bribe following the supply of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits worth over Rs 1 crore by Bioaide to the Himachal Pradesh government. Superintendent of Police in the state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau Shalini Agnihotri, told news Agency PTI that Singh was called for questioning but he evaded a direct reply when he was shown new evidence collected by the bureau. Singh was produced before a court on Sunday. In reply to a question, the SP said the investigation in the matter was underway and it was not yet established whether the bribe was handed over to the now suspended director or not. The arrest comes a days after Rajeev Bindal quit as the state BJP president on “moral grounds”, saying some people were indirectly linking the case with his party. Later, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said that Bindal resigned to ensure an impartial probe into the matter. “Isteefey ke liye na toh humne kaha. Aur unhone jab is saari cheez ko dekha ke media, media ke ilawa dusre kuch log is prakar ki baatein kar rahe hain.. ke naitikta ke aadhar par mujhe sochna chahiye ke is baat ko is tareh se jab liya ja raha hai.. aur aisi paristhiti mei .. jo baatein.. jo vyakti jiske saath conversation hua hai, vo unke nazdeek hai.. usse unko joda ja raha hai.. toh aise mei unhone kaha ke ye jaanch nishpaksh honi chahiye (I didn't ask for his resignation.It was being said that Singh is close to Bindal.his name was being associated with the person. That was why he resigned on moral grounds to ensure an impartial probe),” said Thakur during a press briefing last Thursday. During the briefing, Thakur was also asked why Singh had not been arrested and made an accused in the case even though he had offered the bribe and had made no complaint to any authority. The audio clip reached the vigilance bureau only after it went viral. Gupta was released on bail on May 30, after a court hearing in which the prosecution told the judge that he had attempted to take a bribe but no exchange of money had taken place, and that the viral audio clip was the only incriminating evidence against the accused so far. According to the bail order, the investigating officer informed the court that a team of officials had been deputed to arrest both the “supplier and the officer” anticipating an exchange of bribe. Gupta retired on May 31. Politician-turned-liasioning man Singh, a native of Rajana village in Sangrah, is a former political leader from Renukaji Assembly constituency from where he had unsuccessfully contested the Vidhan Sabha elections on the BSP ticket in 2007, at the age of 33. According to his affidavit filed with the state election department, he cleared his Class 10 from a school in Dharamshala and Class 12 from Delhi in 1997, before pursuing a one-year diploma. His and his wife's assets, according to that affidavit, amounted to Rs 3.75 lakh and they jointly owned two properties worth Rs 32 lakh with others. Singh later switched to the BJP, and also held the position of district president of party's SC Morcha, several politicians in the area told The Indian Express. Former BJP MLA Hirdaya Lal from Renukaji, a relative of Singh, corroborated this. Lal, currently a ""special invitee"" member of the district BJP unit, said that Singh is currently a BJP member and was the president of SC Morcha around 4-5 years ago. ""He helped me in my election campaign, too,"" he said, adding that Singh is into private business. However, Trilok Jamwal, the state general secretary of BJP, said, ""As per my information, Singh is not a member or office-bearer of our party."" He said that he cannot say if Singh was an office-bearer of the party's SC Morcha in the past ""because district level records are only available at our district units"". Another political leader from Renukaji, who did not wish to be named, said that Prithvi later moved his base to Chandigarh and Solan and started liasioning for medical establishments. Bindal link Among the messages being circulated among some members of Congress and BJP since Gupta's arrest are photographs of Prithvi Singh showing him as a staff employee of Apex Diagnostics, a medical testing centre in Solan, run by Bindal's daughter and son-in-law. A visiting card declaring him as a marketing manager of the medical testing centre is also being circulated, while the Facebook page of the centre has several photographs (posted in 2018) of Singh with the rest of the staff. Dr Raj Kumar Gandhi, Bindal's son-in-law, told The Indian Express that Prithvi Singh worked for the centre ""a very long time ago"", and that he does not know anything about the ongoing vigilance probe. However, a woman answering the centre's landline number said that Prithvi Singh was an employee ""who has not been working with us since the time of Covid-19"". Earlier, when the Express contacted Singh on the number given on his Apex Diagnostics visiting card, and asked if he was from Bioaide Corporation, he replied in the affirmative but refused to talk further saying that ""all records have been provided to the vigilance"". Bioaide owners, when contacted, also refused to comment, but an employee answering a landline number admitted that Singh was engaged with the company. Bindal too refused to talk on the matter despite repeated attempts. He had earlier said, ""Jo prashna mere se sambandhit nahi hai, jo vishay mere se juda nahi hai, usko ghumaya media ne.. maine uttar toh de hi diya, aur bada spasht uttar diya hai.

Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Church of Gujarat has decided to maintain 'status quo' of the existing lockdown in view of the pandemic. In Saturday's meeting held by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and state home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja with various religious heads, representatives of the Catholic church had asked the government to consider their request to administer the 'holy communion' to the faithful as it is an intrinsic part of the service and ""cannot be considered as prasad"" which is prohibited in the SOPs. On Sunday, the Catholic diocese issued a video message through its spokesperson informing the believers that the church has decided to maintain a 'status quo' with the ongoing lockdown after examining the protocols laid down by the government. On Saturday, the Muslim clerics had also asked Rupani to excuse the mosques from the mandatory installation of sanitizer dispensers since it is alcohol-based and 'prohibited in Islam'. The Commissioner of Police on Sunday confirmed that the order allows all places of worship to carry on with their regular prayer services so long as the mandatory social distancing and precautions mentioned in the SOPs - originally issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare - are followed. The notification of the Vadodara police, signed by Commissioner of Police Anupam Singh Gahlaut, states, ""All places of religious worship will have to follow the SOPs to precision, which has been enlisted by the health and family welfare department as well as the state government."" The SOPs state that all places of worship must ensure availability of sanitizer dispensers at the entry as well as have provisions for thermal screening. ""Only asymptomatic persons wearing masks will be allowed. If possible, the staggering of visitors is to be done. Footwear to be preferably taken off inside own vehicle or kept in separate slots for each individual. There has to be proper crowd management in the parking lots and outside the premises, duly following social distancing norms. Premises should draw markings to indicate the physical distancing of six feet, even when queuing up for entry,"" the SOPs state. Apart from this there is strict prohibition on touching of statues, idols and holy books as well as large gatherings, groups playing devotional music and choirs. The SOP stresses on the use of recorded songs. In mosques, in adherence to the government SOPs, circulars and boards have been put up advising believers to bring their own prayer mats as well as perform the wudhu (cleansing of hands, legs, face) at home. The SOPs also prohibit any physical offerings like prasad, distribution or sprinkling of holy water in religious places. Even langars and community kitchens have been disallowed. Gahlaut said, ""All religious places are allowed to function as per their ritualistic obligations so long as they adhere to the SOPs. There is no specific mention of Friday (namaz for Muslims) or Sunday (Eucharistic mass for Christians) in the SOP but if they have halls large enough to ensure that their believers can maintain the mandatory six-feet physical distance, then they can hold their service. We will be keeping a strict watch on all religious places as we are yet to reach the Covid-19 peak.

Briefing media persons in Gandhinagar on Sunday, one of the panel members, Dr Tejas Patel, an interventional cardiologist, recipient of the Padmashree award in 2015 and current director of the Apex Heart Institute in Ahmedabad, said, ""A meeting was held one-and-a-half months ago to find out reasons for the high mortality rate (in Gujarat), where a protocol of predictors of mortality in our population was prepared. It was implemented it is difficult to provide a definite answer to why deaths are high here."" Principal Secretary (Health) Jayanti Ravi said, ""We need to understand that the death audits do not conclude a single cause of Covid-19 deaths; there are multiple reasons. Among them are comorbidity and high-risk factors (patients above 60 years and below 10 years), late presentation - detected even in educated populations - where symptoms have been ignored, leading to delayed reporting to hospitals."" Ravi, Dr Patel and seven other expert members of the task force were present at the media briefing where mortality was one among the four topics taken up by the panel. The other three were community health, treatment protocol and dos and don'ts for citizens. Dr Patel said, ""We have to learn from our own experience. There is no permanent solution or answer, it is difficult to find reasons for why death incidents are high in Gujarat. We are trying to find out scientific reasons and where we find lapses, we rectify them. At present, our focus is on saving patients in serious condition."" Another panel member, Dr Maharshi Desai, intensivist and critical care expert at Apollo Hospital, said, ""Controling the death rate through medicines is not possible. Implementation of the healthcare system should be focused on how to provide appropriate care to every patient."" Blaming the Tablighi congregation for high number of cases in Ahmedabad, Dr V N Shah, diabetologist and founder of Zydus Hospital, said, ""It is due to Tablighi and the walled city areas that the highest reports of cases are from Ahmedabad."" He also attributed the caues to the high number of international travellers to the city. Majority of those who returned tested positive, he said. Dr Ami Parikh, head of the medicine department at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-run SVP Hospital, said that weekly death audits of Covid-19 patients at the hospital showed that there are multiple reasons for deaths. ""Thrombosis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm - which is the most dangerous - can lead to damage of organs including lungs, kidneys and heart. There is no system to inspect how the immune system will react to this. In the ARDS condition, there is no way that oxygen from outside reaches the bloodstream."" Dr Parikh is also on the panel of three doctors directed by the Gujarat High Court to look into the 21 issues raised in a report, tabled in the court last month, that had raised several issues in government hospitals. Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) in Gandhinagar, attributed the high mortality rate in Ahmedabad to the high number of city population with obesity, diabetes hypertension and anaemia. ""Along with these, the densely populated city is also one of the reasons,"" he said. Dr Malvankar further said that a reason for why not many cases are being reported from the central or walled city areas is that herd immunity has been developed among the residents. Echoing similar views, Dr Patel said, ""We are at the peak stage of the virus. Slowly, herd immunity will be developed. for which minimum 60 per cent of the population needs to be infected.

Interestingly, these temples got a little over Rs 4.21 lakh in online donation during the Navratras. Three of these temples are situated in Kangra district: Jwalamukhi Temple, Chamunda Temple and Brijeshwari Temple, also known as Kangra Temple. Among the remaining two, one is in Una district - Chintpurni Temple - and the other - Naina Devi Temple - is in Bilaspur district. These temples are run by government trusts headed by respective Deputy Commissioners. Kangra is a curious case. While elsewhere online donations went up as compared to last year, the reverse happened in this district. During last year's Chaitra Navratras, which usually fall in March-April, the Chamunda Temple had got Rs 3,19,453 while it got only Rs 50,255 this year. The Kangra Temple had received Rs 4,46,549 last year. But this year it got only Rs 92,439. So is the case with the Jwalamukhi Temple. Last year, it had got Rs 11,72,993, the highest among the five temples in online offerings, but could get only Rs 1,18,494 this year. Kangra Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati says, ""We were expecting online donations to go up. But they came down."" While the Jwalamukhi Temple contributed Rs 1 crore towards the Covid relief fund, Brijeshwari Temple contributed Rs 50 lakh. DC Prajapati claims they are planning to contribute Rs 21 lakh from the Chamunda Temple as well. The Chintpurni Temple has the distinction of making the maximum contribution and getting the minimum online donation. Last year, it had got only Rs 1,323.65 in online offerings. The amount went up to Rs 4,188.45 this year. The temple, however, made a contribution of Rs 5 crore to the state Covid relief fund. Una Deputy Commissioner Sandeep Kumar says, ""The online donation is insignificant. The concept is yet to pick up here."" The Naina Devi Temple is not an extreme case. It occupies the middle-of-the-road space. It had got Rs 1,53,103 in online offerings last year. The amount went up to Rs 1,55,700 this year. It donated Rs 2.5 crore to the relief fund. Besides, the aarati in the temples was webcast during the Navratras this year. While the Jwalamukhi Temple recorded more than 50,000 views every day, the Chamunda and Kangra temples registered around 20,000 views. The Chintpurni Temple got around 55,000 views every day. No webcasting arrangement was made last year. The Naina Devi Temple did not go in for webcasting of aarati. Bilaspur Deputy Commissioner Rajeshwar Goel says, ""We have a tie-up with Tata Sky.

Officials said the academic sessions are set to resume on Monday and a daily timetable for cadets has been issued. One of the key features of the timetable is staggered timings for various activities within a squadron where time slots have been allotted to cadets from different academic terms. “Since the beginning, the activities where common spaces are shared, are being done in staggered timings. Now the conduct of academic sessions will also be done in the same manner. Each class of say 30 students is being divided into two.

Officials said that during this entire period, cadets were being closely monitored for any symptoms of Covid-19 by their divisional officers, seniors, and civilian instructors. Visitors have not been permitted, be it parents or general populace. These precautionary measures will continue in coming days.

They continue with one more year of training at the academies of their respective forces, including Indian Military Academy in Dehradun, Air Force Academy in Dundigal and Indian Naval Academy in Ezhimala. This year, the passing out cadets are directly being sent to their respective academies instead of going home for a break.

Petrol price in Delhi was hiked to Rs 71.86 per litre from Rs 71.26 a litre till Saturday, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 69.99 per litre from Rs 69.39, according to a price notification of state oil marketing companies. Daily price revision has restarted, an oil company official said. While oil PSUs have regularly revised ATF and LPG prices, they had since March 16 kept petrol and diesel prices on hold, ostensibly on account of extreme volatility in the international oil markets. Auto fuel prices were frozen soon after the government raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates. The government on May 6 again raised excise duties by Rs 10 per litre on petrol and Rs 13 per litre on diesel. Oil companies, instead of passing on the excise hike to consumers, decided to adjust them against the reduction required because of the drop in international oil prices. They used the same tool and did not pass on the Re 1 per litre hike required for switching over to ultra-clean BS-VI grade fuel from April 1. Petrol price in Mumbai and Kolkatta was hiked by 59 paisa each to Rs 78.91 and Rs 73.89 per litre, respectively. In Chennai, the hike was 53 paisa to Rs 76.07, according to the price notification. For diesel, price was hiked by 58 paisa in Mumbai to Rs 68.79 and in Kolkata by 55 paisa to Rs 66.17. In Chennai, the price was hiked from Rs 68.22 to Rs 68.74. While petrol and diesel prices had been kept on hold for nearly three months, they are regularly revised for ATF and LPG despite the fact that the same volatility was witnessed in their prices as well. More importantly, no airline operated between mid-March to May 25 in view of the restrictions placed to check the spread of coronavirus, yet oil companies have continued to revise downward jet fuel prices. In fact, oil companies used to revise ATF prices on the 1st of every month, but adopted fortnightly revisions on March 21 to pass on the benefit of falling international oil prices to airlines. Though the government has deregulated petrol and diesel prices, rate changes have been in the past put on hold by public sector oil companies - Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) - for reasons that appear to be non-commercial. There was a 19-day price freeze on petrol and diesel ahead of Karnataka polls in May 2018, despite international fuel prices going up by nearly USD 5 per barrel. However, no sooner were the elections over, they rapidly passed on to customers the desired increase - over 16-straight days post-May 14, 2018, petrol price climbed by Rs 3.8 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.38 per litre. Similarly, they had stopped revising fuel prices for almost 14 days ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017. These companies had also imposed a freeze on petrol and diesel prices between January 16, 2017 and April 1, 2017, when assembly elections in five states - Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur - were held. During the 2019 general elections, they moderated the revision by not passing on all of the desired increase in rates to consumers, industry sources said.

Mumbai man celebrates birthday on street, bursts crackers; held A 22-year-old man was arrested from Nagpada in south Mumbai for allegedly violating the lockdown and flouting social distancing norms by celebrating his birthday with his friends on a street, and also bursting crackers, police said on Sunday. The accused, Hammad Ansari, who claims to be a social worker, was arrested on Saturday after he shared a video of his birthday celebration on social media, a police officer said. ""Ansari and his friends celebrated his birthday during the intervening night of Friday and Saturday at Madanpura. They burst loud firecrackers and Ansari cut a cake on a street,"" the officer said. ""Through their acts, they violated social distancing norms and the lockdown order. In the video that Ansari had posted on Facebook, he boasted about how he celebrated the birthday despite the restrictions,"" he added. Jaipur firm deploys 7 humanoid robots to cut down physical interaction among employees With a COVID-19-battered world hard-pressed to maintain social distancing, a private firm in Jaipur has deployed seven humanoid robots and other artificial intelligence techniques to reduce human-to-human interaction to almost nil in its functioning. From carrying files from one person to another to marking the attendance of its employees and taking visitors' temperature and regulating their entry to the office, the robots have taken up a slew of works requiring human interactions in the office. A robot guards the entry gate to welcome visitors, performs thermal scanning to check their body temperature and sounds an alert if the visitor is not wearing a face mask. The robotic guard's artificial intelligence is synced with the working of the entry gate, which opens up only after it gets a green signal from the robot. In a situation when most of the offices have stopped taking biometric attendance, the firm has tasked another robot to mark employees' attendance through facial recognition. Another humanoid robot can make its way to assigned employees with a tray carrying files, documents and even tea and snacks. IIT Mandi researchers develop technology for making high-efficiency masks from waste plastic bottles Researchers at IIT Mandi claim to have developed a technology for making high-efficiency masks using waste pet bottles that are not only more breathable than commercially available masks, but also can be washed and reused up to 30 times. The team at the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi has filed a patent for the waste plastic bottles derived filter membrane technology based on electrospinning. The researchers shredded waste plastic bottles and dissolved the pieces using a combination of solvents and extruded nanofibres from the solution. According to Sumit Sinha Ray, Assistant Professor, IIT Mandi, the team used waste plastic bottles to develop a single thin layer of nano-nonwoven membrane that provides desirable particle filtration efficiency, at par with N95 respirator and a medical mask. ""The first concern that comes to mind when we hear that something is made of plastic is whether it is safe to use. These nanofibres meet the safety requirements of the user by excluding the bacteria and infectious components. The breathability in the developed masks is better than the commercially available masks.

In his weekly column 'Rokhthok' in the party's mouthpiece 'Saamana', Raut raised questions on the sudden rise of ""Mahatma"" Sood, and referred to a sting operation ahead of the 2019 General Elections, which showed Sood accepting an offer to promote the BJP-led government on various social media platforms. Sena's attack came in the backdrop of Sood arranging buses and chartered flights for migrant workers stuck in Mumbai. ""Sood is an actor whose profession is to deliver dialogues scripted by someone else and make a living out of it. There are many people like Sood who would promote any political party if paid well,"" Raut wrote. He said no wise person would believe in Sood suddenly developing sympathy for migrants and making arrangements for them to return to their home states. Meanwhile, on Sunday evening, Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray said Sood had come to meet Uddhav. ""This evening Sonu Sood met up with Uddhav Thackeray ji along with Minister Aslam Shaikh ji and me. Better Together, Stronger Together to assist as many people through as many people. Good to have met a good soul to work for the people together,"" Aaditya tweeted.

Good to have met a good soul to work for the people together. pic.twitter.com/NrSPJnoTQ6 — Aaditya Thackeray (@AUThackeray) June 7, 2020 Raut, who is the executive editor of 'Saamana', had said, ""The BJP has (politically) adopted Sonu Sood and tried to create an influence among the North Indian migrant workers. The BJP was struggling to stay politically relevant during the coronavirus crisis and faced a severe backlash from public, who detested the frequent criticism of the Thackeray government by BJP leaders,"" he stated. ""The plight of migrant workers also turned many people against the Modi government for its handling of the coronavirus crisis,"" Raut said. He said it was important to find out whether the BJP had put a mask of a social worker on Sood and used him to further its political game. ""There is a person called Shankar Pawar, who is the head of Rashtriya Banjara Seva Sangh and is  frequently seen standing behind Sood in various photographs. He has the huge system and network to send people home,"" Raut said. Defending the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, which also comprises the NCP and the Congress, over its handling of the migrant crisis, he said, ""No other state could have treated migrant workers the way they have been taken care of by the Maharashtra government."" The government has started a special unit to streamline the process to transport migrant workers to their native states, he said. ""However, to show the state government's work in poor light, Sood has been deliberately promoted. 'If anyone wants to go home, please contact me' was the appeal of the actor,"" Raut wrote. The senior Sena leader also claimed that the Bollywood actor had even got an invitation from Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari as appreciation of his work for the stranded labourers. ""Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta should send a detailed list of people and organisations who served relentlessly and selflessly during the coronavirus crisis. Unfortunately, they do not have any political backing to promote their work,"" Raut said. Taking a dig at the BJP, Raut said people might soon get to hear Sood's name in 'Mann Ki Baat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi's monthly radio programme, and the actor meeting him in person in Delhi. ""Sood might even visit Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi as a star campaigner for the BJP. When most of the actors were sitting at home, Sonu Sood's acting skills were flourishing,"" he stated. ""You do not need a screen all the time to show your acting skills, as has been demonstrated by Mahatma Sood. His political directors are experts in their field. We will soon come to know about his next political move,"" he added. Apart from sending thousands of migrants home, Sood has also lent support to Delhi BJP’s Mission Anivarya, which is aimed at free distribution of sanitary pads among underprivileged women in the midst of the Covid-19 lockdown. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh denied Shiv Sena having any such opinion of Sood and said the party will appreciate whoever takes good initiatives. Talking to news agency ANI, ""Actor Sonu Sood has done good work by sending a lot of migrant workers to their homes. I did not hear what Sanjay Raut sahab said.

""I have asked from the SP what action has been initiated into the matter. Next action will be taken after studying the report,"" Vij told the media persons. An inquiry conducted by a young IAS officer Uttam Singh, who is Additional Deputy Commissioner of Jhajjar, had pointed out various holes in the police theory in the matter. In his inquiry report submitted to Jhajjar Deputy Commissioner on May 26, the IAS officer had also pointed that the policeman, who is complainant in the case, was not even authorised to lodge a complaint under the Disaster Management Act. The probe also suggested that a doctor of government hospital issued a medical certificate, which police used in their favour, even as the journalist was not taken to the room of the doctor for medical examination. Vij, who holds Home as well as the Health Ministry, said that “if needed the entire episode would be probed including the issue related to medical certificate”. “Certainly, the action will be taken into the matter. I know how to take action in such matters. I will take information regarding the case to ensure action into the matter,” said Vij. When pointed out that an official, who is facing allegations in the matter, is close to a senior police office, he minister said: “Anil Vij doesn't care who is close to whom. Action will be initiated whoever committed the wrong act. Anil Vij stands by those who don’t have anybody to help. I have always fought for the common man. I have always raised their voice.” Khohal is a photo journalist with a Hindi daily in Haryana's Jhajjar town. Hours after he had informed the police about the stone pelting in his neighbourhood, he was arrested for “creating nuisance” and “spreading infection of dangerous disease"", violation of Covid-19 instructions and under Disaster Management Act, 2005. In his statement to ADC Uttam Singh, Khohal had stated, “I was framed in the case. My fault was only that I recorded my statement before DSP Shamsher Singh in connection with the misbehaviour with journalists by City Police Station SHO Roshan Lal in the thana.” On his part, the SHO had termed the allegations against him as false and totally baseless. “Head constable Sandeep Kumar had informed me that Khohal and Vivek were creating a nuisance in a drunken stage in Jhajjar’s Rahniya Colony. I had asked the head constable to take appropriate legal action,” the SHO had stated in his statement to the inquiry officer. Vivek was also arrested in the matter. In his statement to ADC Singh through a recorded video, Vivek had stated that he doesn’t know Khohal. “On the basis of the available evidences, it can’t be established that the FIR registered by Inspector Roshan Lal's (thana) under these sections was appropriate,” concluded Uttam Singh in his report.",mid,3036,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/12/mayawati-2.jpg,Apologise for sending protesters to jail: Maya to Yogi govt,Apologise against sending celebrateers to jail: Maya to Yogi govt,"""I have asked from the SP what action has been initiated into the matter.

A homeopathy practitioner and psychiatrist herself, the 69-year-old believes that awareness and attitude are key to survive the disease. ""I was, in a way, fortunate enough to have addressed cancer in my family right from my early days. My mother, elder sister, two aunts, and a cousin had cancer at some or the other time. Seeing them battle it made me more aware of the fact that surviving is possible. With good doctors exhibiting an optimistic attitude all throughout, I got through it - not once but twice,"" Nadagouder told indianexpress.com For Nadagouder, her first close encounter with the ailment was when her mother was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 1981. ""She was 51 and I was 29 then. This is when I really started to learn about the disease. She was treated successfully with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and then survived for another 16 years,"" she remembers. Nadagouder then took up volunteering with several organisations to help cancer patients with their appointments and counselling. She also started writing columns for local newspapers to raise awareness about the disease. It was later in 2002 that she noticed a big painless lump in her right breast. ""Since it was painless, I ignored it. Six months later, the lump became bigger and a small scar appeared on my skin. It started to pain and hence I rushed to the doctor. On diagnosis, it tested positive,"" she explained. As she moved to Bengaluru from Dharwad for specialised oncology treatment, Nadagouder had options ready. ""I chose the doctor who had performed a successful mastectomy on my sister to be my surgeon. The radiotherapist who had treated my mother successfully treated me too,"" she said. After 18 lymph nodes removal and 28 radiotherapy sittings from three different doctors in over six months, her health started improving. Nadagouder thinks that the support provided by family and caregivers is as important as the treatment. ""While being a loving grandmother to my first grandson diverted my mind from the side-effects of the treatment, having something to fight for helped me recover faster,"" she added. Later, when Nadagouder was undergoing treatment for cancer in 2018 — for the second time - her husband, daughter, and a friend shaved their heads in support of breast cancer treatment. ""Things like these are important because it expresses to the patient that he/she is not alone,"" she said. Nadagouder is now a 'survivor tutor' at The University of Adelaide in Australia, where her daughter is settled. ""From knowing about cancer as nothing more than my zodiac sign to speaking at a global stage on my experiences, I feel awareness is key as technology and treatment gets better each day,"" she said.

Bihar is scheduled to go to the Assembly polls in October-November this year. ""This rally has nothing to do with elections. The BJP believes in democracy. I want to salute the crores of corona warriors who are fighting against the virus by risking their lives.

It came close on the heels of the killing of Rajyapal Nagose from Bamangaon village on June 4. “Four incidents earlier have been caused by the same tiger as camera trap images have shown. Since Sunday’s incident also happened in the same area, it is most likely by the same tiger. But we will be able to say that for sure only after getting camera images tomorrow,” said Guruprasad, Deputy Conservator of Forest, TATR. Asked why no orders have still been issued to capture the tiger despite at least four confirmed killings when the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) guidelines require only two fatal attacks, Guruprasad said, “The first two incidents were in core area, which is inviolate space and hence the tiger can’t be seen as responsible. But we had sought advice from the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest after the next two incidents. The fifth one happened before we could take a call after the fourth incident.” The incidents in TATR core and buffer areas began on February 15, when a man from Kolara village was killed. It was followed by an incident on April 8 and later by another in May. With this, the total number of people killed in big cat attacks in Chandrapur this year has so far reached 14, one of which is by a leopard while the rest are by tigers.

According to the Inflation Monitor for April issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the country witnessed highest inflation not only in comparison with the developed economies but also with emerging economies, the Dawn News reported. The SBP pushed up interest rates to cool down the inflationary pressure during the fiscal year but high rates proved counterproductive as they further increased inflation while the private sector stopped borrowing costly money hampering industrial growth and services. The month of January witnessed a 12-year high inflation at 14.6 per cent. In response to the rising prices, the SBP rose the interest rates to 13.25 per cent. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the entire economic scenario was turned upside down as demand contraction lowered inflation, forcing the SBP to cut down interest rates to 5.25 per cent within just three months, the daily reported. The rate cut announcement came as inflation slowed down, falling to 8.2 per cent in May, much lower than the SBP projections for the month. Detailed graphs accompanying the SBP's Inflation Monitor show Pakistan's inflation, when compared to developing economies like China, Thailand, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, has fallen since the pandemic. The July-May inflation for the current fiscal year slipped below to the State Bank's earlier projection of 11 per cent to 10.94 per cent. The number is expected to drop further in June. The government has slashed petroleum prices thrice during the two months, which drastically reduced the cost of production, transportation and finally reduced inflation. Trade and industrial sectors, while demanding cuts to interest rate, also believe the economy needs additional injection of Rs 3-4 trillion for full recovery. However, with sharp economic slowdown, the revenue collection has also fallen short of target this year, making further liquidity injection on such a large scale impossible for the government. The SBP has provided relief amounting to hundreds of billions in the form of principal payments deferrals, debts rescheduling and lending on easier terms for the industrial sector to avoid massive layoffs, according to the paper. &nbsp;",short,2454,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/12/smriti-irani.jpg?w=600,Smriti Irani attacks Oppn over CAA ‘politics’,Smriti Irani attacks Oppn over CAA ‘politics’,"The government has slashed petroleum prices thrice during the two months, which drastically reduced the cost of production, transportation and finally reduced inflation.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pakistan-sees-highest-inflation-in-the-world-during-2020-sbp-6447154/

While the RJD, led by former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi and party chief Tejashwi Yadav, observed 'Garib Adhikaar Diwas' by beating utensils, the Congress took to posters to urge citizens to mark ""Shraddhanjali Diwas'. The posters read 'virtual se actual muddon ka encounter'.

Speaking to news agency ANI, a JD(U) leader said: ""People of Bihar have come to know about 15 years of misrule. The citizens here know very well about the RJD. Everyone is clapping their hands while they're beating the utensils. That's all they know, they haven't done anything to respect anyone till date."" BJP chief Amit Shah is slated to address party workers at approximately 72,000 booths to reach out to its cadres and workers across the state. The BJP claims nearly 5 lakh party workers would listen to Shah’s speech on YouTube, Facebook Live and on the Namo app. The event is being touted as a formal launch of the electoral process in Bihar, which is scheduled to go to the Assembly polls in October-November this year. Amid criticisms from the Congress and RJD, Bihar BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said Shah’s virtual rally is a way to digitally address the cadres, Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand told The Indian Express: “Sunday’s virtual rally would be a culmination of our two-month-long efforts to make our cadre – down to the booth level – tech-savvy. Almost all our key functionaries use smartphones and are now familiar with Zoom meetings and party WhatsApp groups. Our state president had held a video meeting at levels of mandals and shakti kendra in groups.” Asked what the focus of Shah’s virtual rally would be, Anand said he could speak on the achievements of the second Narendra Modi government in its first year, and how the Centre has tackled the Covid challenge. Asked whether it is right to go on election mode at a time Bihar is still in the grip of the pandemic, Anand said: “The virtual rally is a bid to stay connected with the party at the base level. Let the Opposition interpret it the way they would like to.” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tewari said: “Our leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has also held Zoom meetings; we also have WhatsApp groups, but we are not thinking of elections like the BJP is. We stay connected to help migrant workers, some of whom have also become our party members.” Denying that BJP is the only party making a digital outreach, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party president Upendra Kushwaha added he, too, did Facebook Live sessions to take up the issue of migrants workers. Congress party secretary Chandan Yadav said, “While the BJP has gone in election mode, as is reflected through its digital connectivity, our top leaders are connected (with the people) through WhatsApp, and we have run several campaigns against mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis by the Bihar government.” In Bihar, BJP’s organisational structure includes 45 organisational districts, 1,100 mandals, 9,000 shakti kendras and 72,000 booths.",mid,3483,NEGATIVE,https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/uddhav-2.jpg,"Have not resigned, not unhappy: Sena’s Abdul Sattar","Have not resigned, not unsad: Sena’s Abdul Sattar","The ruling Janata Dal (United), who is in alliance with the saffron party, opposed the RJD protest by clapping their hands.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bihar-elections-amit-shah-virtual-rally-rabri-devi-tej-pratap-yadav-clang-utensils-6446904/

It further noted that the meeting was held in a positive atmosphere and hinted that it could first in the series of meeting, as it stated that the dialogue will continue at military and diplomatic levels.

Ahead of the Saturday meeting of the army commanders, Indian and Chinese ambassadors joined a video call between diplomats of their border working mechanism to underline that “the two sides should handle their differences through peaceful discussion” and “not allow them to become disputes”. Officials in Delhi had cautioned that the meeting, first at such a senior level of army leadership on both was unlikely to resolve the situation. India wants China to restore status quo ante on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which means that going back to the positions before China diverted its forces from a military exercise to the border with India. Since the standoff began on May 5, Indian troops have not been allowed to go beyond Finger 4 on north bank of Pangong Tso, compared to earlier when Indian patrols could go 8 kilometers further till Finger 8, which is the LAC according to India.

These deaths remain concentrated — over 80 per cent in 26 districts, the Covid hotspots. Indeed, Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, and Chennai were the only districts with more than 100 deaths these past two weeks. They saw 1,964 deaths over this period, almost half of their total 4,055 Covid deaths. But India’s case fatality ratio (CFR, number of deaths per 100 cases) still remains low — 2.8 per cent. Globally, the CFR is 5.8 per cent. In the US, it is 5.7 per cent, in Brazil it is 5.5 per cent, and in Russia it is 1.2 per cent.

Most of these districts seeing their first Covid deaths are in Uttar Pradesh (18) and Bihar (13) — reflecting the spread. Similarly, there are around 700 districts in the country (out of a total 736) that have reported at least one Covid case.

Other than these six major hotspots, 20 districts recorded between 10 and 100 new deaths over this period amounting to 594 new deaths — 43 per cent of their 1,375 total deaths. The majority of districts (around 205) saw between 10 and one new deaths, mostly in Uttar Pradesh (40), Madhya Pradesh (22), and Gujarat (21). But while new districts are seeing their first deaths, the number of districts seeing large numbers is not changing significantly.

Last month, Delhi said that the Foreign Secretaries, Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Shankar Das Bairagi, will discuss the issue “after” the two countries have “successfully dealt” with the Covid-19 pandemic.
